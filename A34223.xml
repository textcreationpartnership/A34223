            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>The <hi>Memoires</hi> of Heroical Perſons, vvhoſe efforts have been to make the <hi>Science of Saints</hi> their chiefeſt ſtudy, and their heigheſt ambition to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in Vertue, cannot but find a gracious acceptance under the <hi>Protection</hi> of Your Royal Name; ſince Your Majeſty not only by vvords, but by an unparallel'd examples, has ſo openly declar'd in favor of Vertuous Actions before all other Titles, even to <hi>Crovvns</hi> and <hi>Scepters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongſt theſe <hi>Great</hi> Souls, this Lady, vvhoſe Life I Write, muſt be Regiſtre'd, vvhoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb facs="tcp:56701:3"/>ſo long conceal'd, by a ſignal Providence have taken air, and are come to light.</p>
            <p>The Monaſtry of <hi>Graveling,</hi> in vvhich ſhe liv'd, and Crovvn'd her Merits by a happy Death, vvas alvvays look'd upon as a <hi>Nurſery</hi> of eminent Sanctity; but <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> ſeems to be their darling Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: For theſe Humble Virgins being hid from the Eyes of Men, that they might be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous to thoſe of God and his Angels, vvere never vvilling to tranſmit to Poſterity, vvhat othervvays might juſtly deſerve the higheſt eſteem and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and conſequently the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignals I have made uſe of in
<pb facs="tcp:56701:4"/>compiling the Actions of this holy perſons Life, have by the importunity and Authority of the Honorable Lady <hi>Anne Nevil</hi> of happy Memory, late Abbeſs of <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> been rather extorted from the Monaſtry of <hi>Grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> than freely offer'd; ſo that I am beholden to my Ladies Zeal for the greateſt part of the Memoires vvhich ſhe had indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly got together, vvith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to have put them into ſuch a Method as might fit them for the Preſs; yet all that either my Lady Abbeſs, vvhilſt ſhe liv'd, or I ſince her Death have been able to procure, are ſo fevv, in compariſon of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:56701:4"/>many Vertues my Lady <hi>VVar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> practis'd, that I can give my Reader but a faint <hi>Idea,</hi> and ſmall Scantling of them.</p>
            <p>After all my endeavours, I knovv theſe ſmall <hi>Eſſays</hi> vvill not eſcape hard Cenſures, and no Precaution can ſecure me from ſevere Challenges upon this <hi>Subject.</hi> The refin'd Policy of Worldlings vvill never be able to brook this <hi>Hidden Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> nor look this <hi>Lady</hi> in the Face, vvho in the flovver of her Youth, ſo generouſly ſlighted the Charms of a plentiful Fortune, of a loving Huſband, and of her deareſt Children, to make her ſelf an intire Sacrifice to God.
<pb facs="tcp:56701:5"/>Theſe proceedings, I ſay, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in a <hi>Pretended Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> vvill be traduc'd as the higheſt Folly and greateſt piece of Bigotry; vvhen indeed the follovving Evangelical Counſels has alvvays been one of the <hi>Diſcriminating Teſts,</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctive Signs</hi> of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon, Madam, I make again my humble Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to beſeech Your Majeſty to vouchſafe to receive this ſmall <hi>Treatiſe</hi> under Your <hi>Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</hi> 'Tis true, Vertue is very povverful, but Obloquies are like to be ſo great on the one ſide, and my endeavours
<pb facs="tcp:56701:5"/>to dravv her true Lineaments to the Life, ſo vveak on the other, that Your ſupporting hand vvill be vvanting to encounter the firſt and ſuſtain the ſecond.</p>
            <p>The Picture of my <hi>Lady,</hi> in the Frontiſpiece of this Book, is vvithout Flattery very <hi>Lovely:</hi> But vvhoever Reads her Life, muſt confeſs the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of her Soul vvere incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more Amiable. For my part, I vvonder not that Vertue vvas Hereditary to her; becauſe if a <hi>good Tree</hi> muſt needs bear <hi>good Fruit,</hi> 'tis not to be admir'd that a good Child ſhould be Born of a good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? My <hi>Ladies</hi> Mother had
<pb facs="tcp:56701:6"/>ſo ſvveet an Air, and ſo vvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Comportment, that ſhe gain'd the Hearts of all, vvith vvhom ſhe converſt. Nay, our late Queen of happy Memory, <hi>Henrietta Maria</hi> Mother to Our Gracious Soverain, vvas ſo far taken vvith her, that ſhe choſe her to be one of her Maids of Honor.</p>
            <p>Hovv far more advantagious is the Fortune or the Daughter, ſince Your <hi>Majesty</hi> has been Graciouſly pleas'd to allovv the beſt Actions of her Life to be Addreſt to Your Self? They muſt needs Live for ever by this Immortal Favor, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on by thoſe Rays of
<pb facs="tcp:56701:6"/>Majeſty vvhich ſuffer no Eclipſe, and which by the oppoſition of a Malign Darkneſs give ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a greater Light: For a Queen to be truly <hi>Great,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvays to be the <hi>ſame,</hi> vvhether Fortune ſmiles, or frovvns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Her; neither Elevated in <hi>Proſperity,</hi> nor Dejected in <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,</hi> but ſhevving the <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of Her Soul in deſpiſing all things beneath it. This Golden Mean, this equal Temper, the Chriſtian World has alvvays admir'd in Your Majeſty; but never more, than in this preſent Conjuncture. Hence, Madam, I humbly conceive Your Majeſties Name the moſt Proper un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:56701:7"/>Heaven to Countenance ſuch a Work, as deſigns (by dravving the Picture of a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Lady) to publiſh, and praiſe the Contempt of an unconſtant World. For vvhat can ſpeak ſo efficaciouſly as Your Example, the inſtability of all Human Felicity? For as Your preſent State offers forcible Motives tovvards the diſparaging of all Worldly Greatneſs, ſo the conſideration of Your Royal Patience and unſhaken Conſtancy, cannot but comfort the moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and heal the vvounds even of the moſt deſperate.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:56701:7"/>
            <p>Theſe Vertues, Madam, grounded on Chriſtian Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity muſt neceſſarily at length be Crovvn'd : 'Tvvas Prudence, in not vvreſtling vvith the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Waves, and furious Tumults of an <hi>ungrateful People,</hi> vvhich has ſav'd us the beſt of <hi>Kings,</hi> the beſt of <hi>Queens,</hi> and the moſt hopeful of <hi>Princes:</hi> The humoring of a Storm is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the beſt vvay to Steer a Veſſel ſecurely into the Haven.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LTHO' Vertue ſtands in need of no additional Luſter; yet commonly the Ornaments of Nature are never wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to accompany the high Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of Grace, and for the moſt part Sanctity of Life has been attended by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56701:11"/>Nobility of Birth and good Education. The Lady <hi>VVarner</hi> had no ſmall advantages in this kind.</p>
                  <p>She was Born on the 20th. of <hi>April</hi> the Year 1636. at <hi>Hanmer</hi>-hall in the Town of <hi>Hanmer,</hi> in the County of <hi>Flint,</hi> the Ancient Seat of the Family, whoſe Name it bears; and after a few days ſhe there received her Chriſtian Name of <hi>Trevor</hi> in Baptiſm, from my Lord Baron <hi>Trevor</hi> her God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father. Her Father was Sir <hi>Thomas Hanmer</hi> Baronet, whoſe fidelity and loyalty recommended him to the Honorable Employment of Cup-bearer to King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt. Her Mother was Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Baker,</hi> of the Ancient Family of the <hi>Bakers</hi> of <hi>VVhittingham</hi>-hall in the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> whoſe Birth, Natural Parts, Beauty and Education, rendred her worthy to be choſen by the Queen <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> for one of her Maids of Honor.</p>
                  <p>Soon after her Birth the Civil Wars of <hi>England</hi> began, in which her Father employed the utmoſt of his Power for the Intereſt of the King his Maſter, but finding after his Majeſties Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment no poſſibility of rendring him any farther ſervice, rather then remain a ſad and uſeleſs Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of His Miſery, he choſe to leave the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to go for <hi>France,</hi> where he might be able to expreſs more evident Teſtimonies of his Duty, than he could in his own Country; in which he was dayly expoſed to the danger of Impriſonment, and other inconveniences incident to thoſe times. Here it was ſhe began firſt to diſcover her incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to a Religious Life, and Pious deſires to caſt thoſe ſeeds which afterwards growing up,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56701:11"/>came to that ripneſs and maturity. For Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> carrying her with his Lady to <hi>Paris,</hi> happened to take up his Lodgings in a Catholic Houſe; ſhe was then about Ten Years Old, and in a ſhort time had gain d ſo much upon the Son and Daughter of that Family (who were about her Age, and had inform'd her how happy a Life the Religions of their Church lead, and had given her ſuch an Idea of it, as had inflam'd her to embrace it) as to obtain of them privatly to accompany her to the Monaſtry of <hi>Mont-Martyr,</hi> a little out of the Town, where her want of experience perſwaded her ſhe ſhould be received as ſoon as ſhe preſented her ſelf: For this end ſhe gathered together what Cloaths and other thing ſhe had, which ſhe did not ſo carfully put up, but that ſhe dropt them as ſhe paſſed through the Houſe whereby her Plot was diſcovered, and her deſign blown up, and all the reward ſhe received for her intended Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was a ſevere correction from my Lady her Mother, thô then detained in bed by her laſt ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but thô this deſign was hindred, ſhe went on in her wonted innocent divertiſments of making and adorning little Oratories whilſt others play'd.</p>
                  <p>The Death of my Lady gave Sir <hi>Thomas Hanmer</hi> more liberty of returning privatly to <hi>England</hi> to ſee how his private concerns went there, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he might be any ways uſeful to his Maſter. Beginning his Journy he left his Daughter <hi>Trevor</hi> in the care of an Ancient Burgher and his Wife, who were <hi>Hugenots,</hi> and had no Children;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56701:12"/>where ſhe might be out of danger of improving ſuch deſigns as formerly ſhe attempted, which he and his Lady, who were both Proteſtants, could not but diſapprove.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> contriving, for his greater ſecurity, whilſt he was in <hi>England,</hi> to keep as far from his own home as he could; retired to <hi>Hengrave</hi>-hall, near <hi>Bury</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> where Sir <hi>Thomas Harvey</hi> a Loyal Subject and ſufferer for the King, having Married my Lady <hi>Penelope Gage,</hi> whoſe Joyntur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe it was, lived with his whole Family. Here Sir <hi>Thomas Hanmer</hi> moved by the beauty and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent endowments of Mrs. <hi>Suſan Harvey,</hi> Daughter of Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> makes his earneſt Suit to her, and at laſt having obtained her Father's and her conſent, Married her.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Hanmer's</hi> thoughts were either ſo taken up with his new Miſtriſs, or ſo diſtracted with the danger of thoſe troubleſome times, that he ſeemed almoſt to have forgotten his Daughter, who had now been above a Year in <hi>Paris</hi> without hearing from him, or of him; inſomuch, that the People with whom ſhe was, believed him Dead, and looked upon it as a favorable effect of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that had this way found a means of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them an Heireſs, whom they eſteemed and loved as if ſhe had been their own Child, and reſolved to make her ſo, as much as they were able: Such was her admirable ſweet diſpoſition as it won the hearts and affections of all ſhe convers'd with. But whilſt they pleaſed themſelves with this Treaſure Providence they thought had ſent them,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56701:12"/>Sir <hi>Thomas Hanmer</hi> returned and daſht all their hopes, and as a Teſtimony of his affection, came expreſly himſelf to fetch her over into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being, returned to <hi>England</hi> he gave her choice, either to go with him to her Mother in-law in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> or to live with her Grand-Mother the Lady <hi>Hanmer</hi> at <hi>Haughton</hi> in <hi>Flintshire,</hi> which laſt place ſhe choſe. Here the former thoughts ſhe had at <hi>Paris</hi> returned, and ſhe deſiſted not to form new deſigns of executing them; which her Grand-mother diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering gaue notice of them to her Father; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe her want of ability to mannage them, might have expoſed her to ſeveral inconveniences, which her want of experience could not foreſee.</p>
                  <p>Her Father upon this Information ſends for her to <hi>Hengrave,</hi> where ſhe is received with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable kindneſs by my Lady her Mother-in-law, which ſhe returned with what dutiful reſpect and affection ſhe was able: Here ſhe beg'd and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd of her Father (knowing into what a narrow compaſs his plentiful Eſtate was contracted, by reaſon of Sequeſtration, and other inconveniences he lay under) that he would not put himſelf to the expences of giving her a Servant; deſigning hereby to inure her ſelf to the exerciſe of ſuch labors, as ſhe could not otherwiſe have the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of practiſing; whereby ſhe might be the better able to prepare her ſelf for the like labors in Religion, to which ſhe ſtill found her ſelf ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined: And one day whilſt ſhe was buſied in rubing her Chamber, her Father ſuddenly came in upon her, and finding her upon her Knees all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56701:13"/>in a ſweat, took her up in his Arms and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced her, with Tears in his Eyes telling her, <hi>God would one day give her a particular bleſsing, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming her ſelf after ſo particular a manner to thoſe Circumstances, his Providence, and her kindneſs to himſelf had reduced her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The troubles ſtill rather increaſing than dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> (that his Family might not be too troubleſome to his Father-in-law) reſolved to go and live with his Mother at <hi>Haughton;</hi> but he ſtayed not long there, for Sir <hi>Thomas Harvey</hi> urging his Daughters return to him again, Sir <hi>Thomas Hanmer</hi> accepted his kind invitation, and left his Daughter behind him, where her former deſires of a Religious Life returned; and to fit her ſelf the better for that State, ſhe hoped ſooner or later to enjoy, ſhe reſolved to ſet upon the practice of thoſe Mortifications ſhe was likely to undergo; and preluding as it were to thoſe Pious Auſterities, ſhe began to Faſt once a week, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from Meat and Drink till night, ſhe riſe conſtantly at Midnight to her Prayers, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed ſuch labors and humble Offices, as were only fit for her Servant, upon pretext ſhe found them beneficial to her health. She had her time hourly regulated from Morning till Night, a Method ſhe began to practice whilſt ſhe was in <hi>France,</hi> and never after omitted, ſtill making Rule and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Standard of her Actions. She was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious in whatever ſhe undertook, that ſhe never failed to accompliſh it, and by her inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, not only learnt the <hi>French</hi> Tongue whilſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56701:13"/>ſhe was at <hi>Paris,</hi> but without the help of any Maſter, acquir'd ſuch a ſufficient knowledge of the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Tongues, as to underſtand any Book.</p>
                  <p>Having lived ſome time in this manner here, her Father ſent for her to <hi>London</hi> with deſign to take her to live with him at <hi>Leusham</hi> not far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from thence, whether his Lady and he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved privatly to retire themſelves in thoſe trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome times. Finding him here alone, her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law not being yet come out of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> ſhe thought this a good occaſion given her of bringing about her deſign; wherefore ſhe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly intreated him, that ſince there was no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of better Times in <hi>England,</hi> (<hi>Cromwel</hi> having baniſhed the Cavaliers, as well as Sequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated their Eſtates) but rather that they would grow worſe, and he become leſs able to provide for her, than now he was; and if it pleaſed God, that any misfortune ſhould happen to him, ſhe knew how much it would be augmented by the thoughts of what ſhe would be like to ſuffer, and ſince her inclinations were wholy fixed upon it, deſir'd him, that he would be pleas'd to give her leave to go beyond-ſea, and alſo, wherewith to enter into a Monaſtry, where ſhe might both live ſecurly, and die happily. Her Reaſons were ſo ſolid and convincing, that he knew not what other Anſwer to return, than a grant to her requeſt; and his Affection for her was ſuch, that he thought the giving her Liberty in this particular could in no kind be ſo preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to her, as thoſe ſufferings ſhe might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56701:14"/>if he denyed her, and any misfortune ſhould happen to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Having gain'd her Fathers conſent, ſhe makes her application to ſome of her Catholic acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to beg their Aſſiſtance, to find a Prieſt that might direct her to ſome Monaſtry. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſo ordain'd, that the perſon to whom upon this occaſion ſhe was recommended, was one of her own Family, <hi>viz.</hi> Father <hi>Hanmer</hi> of the <hi>Society of Ieſus,</hi> who took to Heart her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and advis'd her to go to <hi>Paris</hi> to enter there into a Monaſtry of the Order of Saint <hi>Bennet,</hi> that he ſhould recommend her to; and giving her the Rules of Saint <hi>Bennet,</hi> told her what Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was requir'd for her admittance, which Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was contented to give; and moreover, he undertook to be her Conducter thither, and the very day was appointed, on which they were to begin their Journy.</p>

                     <p>Her Pious Deſigns are croſſed by her Mother-in-law, and what happen'd to her till the time of her Marriage.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>GReat Reſolutions are ſeldom undertaken (eſpecially in the way of Vertue) which meet not with great oppoſitions; the hopes the young Lady had conceived of Conſecrating her ſelf to God in a Religious Family, were nipt in the very bud: For the Night before ſhe was to ſet out from <hi>London,</hi> my Lady <hi>Hanmer</hi> her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law came thither, and being inform'd, that Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> had given his conſent for his Daughters going beyond-ſea to be a Nun, uſed ſuch moving Arguments to perſwade him to recal his conſent, as had their effect. Telling him all the World would look upon it as an Argument of her unkindneſs, that having one only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he ſhould diſpoſe of her no better, than to Impriſon her in the Incloſure of a Monaſtry: That it would give ſuſpition alſo to the World, that he himſelf was a Papiſt, and conſequently expoſe him to greater difficulties than he lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at preſent, They being Perſecuted no leſs for their Religion, than for their Loyalty. Theſe Arguments caus'd Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> to recal his conſent,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56701:15"/>and reverſe all his former promiſes. His Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thô ſhe receiv'd his Commands of ſtaying with ſubmiſſion, yet the ſorrow to ſee herſelf on a ſuddain depriv'd of that happineſs ſhe thought herſelf ready to poſſeſs, was not ordinary. As chearfully as ſhe could, ſhe accompanied her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and my Lady to <hi>Leusham,</hi> where for a Year ſhe continued much the ſame kind of Life ſhe had lead at <hi>Haughton,</hi> at the end of which her Father leaving <hi>Leusham</hi> ſent her to live with Mrs. <hi>Ellis</hi> a Relation of his at <hi>Halrhey</hi> in <hi>VVales.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A fier which is ſmother'd for a time, ſeldom fails of breaking forth afreſh, yea, rather ſeems by Impriſonment to get force and ſtrength; ſo it hapen'd with this young Lady, who being now more mature than formerly, ſhe thought upon ſuch probable means as were likely to enable her to effect her deſires, which were theſe. Her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having given her ſuch a yearly allowance, as his preſent circumſtances would permit him, it being ſhort of what the maintaining of her, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her Quality requir'd, ſhe took this pretence to beg leave ſhe might buy Barly, and get it made into Malt, and Sell it to his own Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, by the profit of which ſhe hop'd to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her allowance, to a competency for her maintainance after ſuch a manner as became his Daughter; ſhewing hereby her Humility to ſubmit herſelf to ſo baſe and ſordid a means, to compaſs ſo glorious an end, as ſhe aim'd at. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> not being able to allow her more, upon condition ſhe ſold only to his own Tenants, gave
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56701:15"/>his conſent, which ſhe having obtain'd, pleas'd her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the imagination of being again enabled to compaſs her wiſhes, and in a ſhort time by her good Huſwifry to improve that little ſtock allow'd her, to ſuch a Summ as Father <hi>Hammer</hi> had told her would be ſufficient, to obtain her Admittance into a Monaſtry. But whilſt ſhe was thus in purſuit of ſo Pious an intention, it fell to the ground; her, Fathers Tenants in thoſe troubleſome times grew ſo poor that they were not able to pay for what they had bought of her.</p>
                  <p>This deſign alſo failing, inſtead of laying aſide the thoughts of a Religious Life, which ſeemed now an improbable thing to hope for; ſhe ſtill hoped even againſt hope, and reſolved at leaſt never to Marry, that thereby ſhe might not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitate herſelf for that Happineſs ſhe ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired. Times growing now a little better, her Father was offer'd ſeveral conſiderable Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for her, which he preſſed her to hearken to, by the ſame Arguments ſhe had uſed to him, to perſwade him to give his conſent for her being Religious: <hi>Viz.</hi> That if any misfortune ſhould happen to him, the thoughts, that he had provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for her, would be a comfort to him in it, and therefore earneſtly deſired her to accept of any one of theſe offers, ſhe liked beſt. She on the other ſide beg'd of him to ſhew the continuance of his Affection to her, by not preſſing her to embrace that courſe of Life to which ſhe had a greater averſion than to any thing in the World; and that no heavier croſs could happen to her
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56701:16"/>than that of Marriage. Her Father at that time deſiſted from any farther importunity, but a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet who was one of her earneſt Suiters did not from his; to avoid which, ſhe beg'd leave of her Father to go out of the Country, and obtain'd his conſent for her going to live at Mr. <hi>Hawley's</hi> at <hi>Brainford</hi> near <hi>London.</hi> Hither ſhe came ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a Couſin German of hers, Mrs. <hi>Catherin Kinnaſton,</hi> who had lived with her at <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhey,</hi> where they had contracted a very particular friendſhip. But here ſhe was not freed as ſhe hop'd from her Suitors importunity, who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, and had gain'd her Fathers Letter to her, to perſwade her to grant his requeſt. Her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Letter, joyn'd with the Baronets importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, wrought much upon her; but he having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſeveral denyals by word of mouth, reſolved to make his laſt attempt by Letter, in which he very pathetically expreſs'd his Paſſion for her, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her amongſt other things, <hi>That whatever he ſuffer'd if she deny'd him now, it should be the laſt ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation he would ever give her the trouble of.</hi> This Letter, with her Fathers perſwaſions in his, put her into a doubt what to do, and in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity ſhe conſulted her Couſin, who uſed all the Arguments ſhe could to prevail with her, not to give him any farther denyal. Her powerful Counſel had ſuch an aſcendency over her, that ſhe Writ him a civil Anſwer, which ſhe had no ſooner done, and given it her Maid to ſend away, but the thoughts of the former happineſs ſhe had propos'd, return'd in ſo forcible a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56701:16"/>and the reſolutions ſhe had taken of not puting her ſelf into any condition, that might render her uncapable of that happineſs, came ſo lively to her thoughts; that almoſt before her Maid was down Stairs, ſhe called her back, took the Letter from her, and immediately burnt it, giving her another, in which ſhe deſired her Suiter, if he had the Affection he pretended for her, to ſhew it by keeping his promiſe, in never more troubling her in that nature.</p>
                  <p>It was no wonder, that this, as well as other Perſons of Quality, expreſſed ſo great an earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of gaining her; ſince both her Exterior and Interior were ſuch, as challeng'd the Affections and Admiration of all that knew her; and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, I cannot have a fitter place to give the Reader a ſatisfactory diſcription, and a ſhort pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture of both, than this. She was above the Middle Stature of Women, excellently well ſhapt, her Complexion not extraordinary fair, but comely and laſting, her Featurs were charming, her Eyes brown as well as her hair; and her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance had ſuch a particular ſweetneſs, as ſeveral Painters who drew her Pictures admired, but own'd their skill not ſufficient to expreſs. This beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Symmetry of her Body, was accompanied with no leſs lovely Qualities of her Mind. Her humor was grave and ſerious, yet ſweetn'd with ſuch an affability, that render'd her converſation no ways diſagreeable or uneaſie, but ſought after and deſired by All. This created a freedom in thoſe ſhe convers'd with, as the other kept them
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56701:17"/>in a certain becoming diſtance. She was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent friend, and where ſhe once took a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, 'twas impoſſible for any to alter it, and thô ſhe choſe very few, to whom ſhe expreſſed a particular friendſhip; yet the choice ſhe made, evidenc'd the goodneſs of her judgment, they being ſuch, as deſerv'd it. She was mild and not eaſily mov'd to anger, yet her meekneſs did not hinder the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of her reſentments, when ſhe had juſt cauſe: She was a lover of frugality and induſtry, ſet a high value upon time, and had every hour of the day regulated; took no Reſolutions, but with mature conſideration, and was as conſtant in the execution of what ſhe once reſolv'd upon. She had a clear and peircing wit, Maſculine Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a fruitful Memory, whereby ſhe came to underſtand ſeveral Languages beſides her own, and a Prudence in buſineſs, above the ordinary capacity of a Woman. She was ſo bigotted to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion ſhe was brought up in, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the intreaties, or promiſes of her Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sir <hi>Iohn Hanmer,</hi> could perſwade her to alter it, who at his return our of <hi>Portugal</hi> (where he became a Catholic whilſt he Studied in the <hi>English</hi> Seminary at <hi>Lisbon</hi>) was ſo Zealous for his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as often upon his Knees with Tears, he beg'd her to embrace it: Yet all this could never move her, thô ſhe paſſionatly lov'd him, to a leſs Eſteem, or Affection for her own Religion, which nothing, but the hopes ſhe had of being Religious, could ever make her think of quiting; and ſhe was very often uſed to ſay, <hi>That thoſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56701:17"/>Deſires ſo tranſported her, as often as they occur'd, that the ſcarſe thought them inconſiſtent with her own Religion.</hi>

                     <p>The firſt interview between her, and Sir <hi>John Warner,</hi> her Marriage, and behavior in the World.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving given you the diſcription of what ſhe was, it is time to let you know thoſe ſecret, and hidden ways God makes uſe of to draw the Predeſtinate to his ſervice. It happen'd whilſt ſhe liv'd at <hi>Branford,</hi> that the Protector dyed, whoſe Splendid and Magnificent Funeral invited all People to a ſight of it, and her amongſt the reſt, and Providence ſo order'd, that ſhe ſhould be a Spectatreſs with ſome of her friends, in the ſame Balcony, which Sir <hi>Iohn VVarner,</hi> and ſome of his Relations had taken up to behold the ſame Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, it being only ſeperated in the middle to divide the two Companies. Here ſhe was inform'd of Sir <hi>Iohn VVarner,</hi> as well as he of her; to wit, that ſhe was likely, beſides that plentiful Fortune her Father deſign'd her, to be Heireſs to Three Thouſand pound a Year, ſhould her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die without Iſſue, who was not yet Married, and was in Poſſeſſion of Mr. <hi>Bakers</hi> Eſtate, his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56701:18"/>Unckle by his Mother. But both Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> and ſhe were ſo far from any thoughts of Marriage, that what was told them of each other took, no Impreſſion. But what Heaven had ſo happily decreed came at length to be accompliſht.</p>
                  <p>For Sir <hi>Thomas Hanmer</hi> reſolving to leave <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and return to a Houſe of his own called <hi>Betisfield</hi> in <hi>VVales</hi> (where he might now be able to live at quiet) intended to take his Daughter along with him, and for that end, ſent to her to meet him, and her Mother-in-law at <hi>London;</hi> where he ſtay'd ſome time for the Concluſion of a Match that was treating between his Son Sir <hi>Iohn Hanmer,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Alſton's</hi> Daughter, an Heireſs to Seven Hundred Pound a Year, whoſe Mother was Aunt to Sir <hi>Iohn VVarner</hi> by his Fathers ſide; who being lately dead, and Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> now in the Poſſeſſion of his Eſtate, had diſpoſed all things to Travel into <hi>France,</hi> and before this, had began his Journy, had he not by Mrs. <hi>Alſton's</hi> his Aunts intreaties, defer'd it till after his Couſin's Marriage, which within a Fortnight or Three Weeks, was to be Solemnized; whilſt Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> ſtayed here with his Aunt, it happened, that one Day Sir <hi>Iohn Hanmer</hi> came to Viſit his Miſtreſs, and brought his Siſter along with him. Thô the firſt ſight of her made no impreſſion at all, as we have ſaid, upon Sir <hi>Iohn VVarner,</hi> yet this ſecond did, and ſo forcibly too, as to make him immediately lay aſide his former deſigns, and reſolve to make his Applications to her, which he ſhould never have had the confidence to have done, had he

                  <p>Providence, that often times makes uſe of contrary means, to bring about it's own deſigns, appear'd wonderfully in this, and gave her no leſs inclination to receive, than it had given Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> to make his Addreſſes. This was exteamly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd at by thoſe who knew her diſpoſition; nay, even by her ſelf; when ſhe found ſuch an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to what before ſhe had entertain'd ſo great an Antipathy. Infine, ſhe who had ſtood out ſeveral Years Courtſhips from others, was gain'd in Three Weeks time by Sir <hi>Iohn;</hi> who the Week after his Conſin's Eſpouſals, was himſelf Married in <hi>London</hi> by Dr. <hi>Iohn VVarner</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> upon the Seventh of <hi>Iune</hi> 1659.</p>
                  <p>Althô ſhe had now embraced a State of Life, wholy inconſiſtent with that of a Religious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; yet ſhe ſeemed ſtill to have a ſpecial Affection, and Inclination for thoſe Virtues, which even adorn the moſt perfect Calling. And not long after her Marriage, ſhe had a ſingular tryal given her, as well of Humility, as of Patience; which was the more ſenſible, becauſe given by one
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56701:19"/>ſhe ſo paſſionatly lov'd. Sir <hi>Iohn VVarner</hi> having accepted of Sir <hi>Iohn Hanmer</hi>'s, his Brother-in-laws invitation, to live with him at <hi>VVittingham</hi>-hall in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> not far from his own Eſtate; was invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him to take a little Ramble about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, without acquainting his Lady whether he went. At his return, my Lady <hi>VVarner</hi> after an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her Joy to ſee Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> come home ſafe, made a kind Expoſtulation with him, <hi>VVhy he would be ſo unkind, as to leave her ſo long in that ſolicitude, by going and ſtaying ſuch a while abroad without telling her of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>My Lady <hi>VVarner</hi> being now big with Child, and Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> thinking it convenient ſhe ſhould lie in at his own Houſe at <hi>Parham,</hi> motion'd it to her:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56701:19"/>She joyfully accepted the propoſal, and declar'd how much more it would be to her ſatisfaction to live there (notwithſtanding the trouble ſhe knew the care of Houſe-keeping would inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably give her) where ſhe hop'd to be free from ſuch a continual concourſe of Company, which render'd her Life leſs pleaſant where ſhe was; but yet ſhe would never have complain'd of it, had not he kindly made this offer to her: For thô nothing was more pleaſing to her, than Quiet and Retirement; yet ſince ſhe thought the other more grateful to him, ſhe would willingly have Sacrific'd her own ſatisfaction, to give him his.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Eldeſt Siſter, Mrs. <hi>Ann VVarner,</hi> who lived with my Lady <hi>Pettus</hi> her Mother-in-law, at <hi>Caſtor</hi> near <hi>Norwich,</hi> being dangerouſly ill, ſent for him; whether he went, and carried my Lady with him. His Siſter dying, he carried her Body to be buried at <hi>Parham,</hi> and took this occaſion of remaining there; taking his other Siſter Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth VVarner</hi> along with him. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe was no ſooner come, but ſhe was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently Viſited by all in the Neighborhood, and among others, by Sir <hi>Iohn VVarner</hi>'s Nurſe, who upon that account, taking a little more Liberty than the other's did with my Lady (who in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance to the faſhion wore Patches) told her, <hi>Madam, God Almighty has given you a very good Face, why will you ſpoil it with thoſe ugly black things? If he had put them there, I am ſure you could not have taken it well, and with reaſon too, for your Face would
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56701:20"/>not have been half ſo handſome.</hi> This Advice was ſo gratfully accepted, that ſhe immediatly pul'd them off, and never after wore any more.</p>
                  <p>Such paſſages as theſe are often Paradox'd, and Ridicul'd as a peice of bigottry, by thoſe who do not willingly admit of any thing, which may abate their Pride, or take of from their Vanity. How acceptable this innate goodneſs of hers was to Heaven, even before her Converſion, may be gather'd by two great dangers ſhe happily eſcaped.</p>
                  <p>She was naturally fearful in a Coach, and the bad ways, as well as her condition (being now big with Child) ſo augmented this fear, that ſhe would no more make uſe of one, but would rather go to Church on foot, which thô a Mile off the Houſe, ſhe never fail'd to do twice a <hi>Sunday,</hi> even in the Winter time. Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this very troubleſome, and knowing ſhe lov'd to Ride ſingle (being an excellent Horſe-Woman) bought a Horſe for her; which, ſhe was no ſooner got upon, than he threw her down; for (being by the careleſneſs of the Groom Girted too backward) he never left kicking till he diſmounted her, and after ſhe was down, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſtill to kick, came ſeveral times very near her Head with his Feet. It pleaſed God to protect her and her Child ſhe was big withal, from any hurt by this Accident, as he had a little before from another; <hi>Viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> to divert himſelf, coming out of his own Coach wherein ſhe was, to drive another Gentleman's in which the Servants were, he overturn'd
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56701:20"/>it; which ſhe hearing of, and fearing ſome hurt might have come to him, leapt over the Boot of the Coach, not ſtaying to have it taken down as the faſhon was then, to go to him; without receiving any more hurt by this fright, and dangerous leap it occaſion'd; than by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accident before mention'd: Almighty God preſerving her, and her Child for his future ſervice. Her time of Lying-in drawing near, ſhe gave notice or it to her Father; who (thô then at <hi>Betisfield</hi> in <hi>VVales,</hi> near Two Hundred Miles diſtant from <hi>Parham</hi>) to ſhew the paſſionate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection he had for her, took a Journy on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back from thence, at ſo unſeaſonable a time of the Year, to give her the comfort of his preſence; which that ſhe might be ſure not to want, he was with her a Month before ſhe was brought to bed, which was upon the 20th of <hi>March,</hi> 1659.</p>
                  <p>She was Three Days, and Three Nights in Labor; inſomuch, that both hers and the Childs Life were in great danger; and ſhe ſuffer'd ſo great Pain, that ſhe was often tempted to hit her Head againſt the Bed-poſt with ſuch violence, as might put an end to it; but inſtead of giving way to ſuch Temptations, ſhe endeavor'd to ſuffer all with what Patience ſhe was able; looking upon it, as a juſt Puniſhment of God, ha ing neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected thoſe good purpoſe ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56701:21"/>her ſelf uncapable of; hoping it might afterwards embrace that happy Life, ſhe her ſelf had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. Her Daughter (of whom ſhe was at laſt happily Deliver'd) was Chriſtned, and Nam'd <hi>Catherine</hi> (Mrs. <hi>Catherine Kinnaſton</hi> my Lady's Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, and friend we ſpoke of before, being God-mother,) and even before, ſhe was capable of any impreſſion, my Lady <hi>VVarner</hi> began to inſtil ſuch Principles into her, as ſhe hopt might one day have no little prevalence over her Riper Age. This Child was the firſt bleſſing that God beſtow'd upon her; and the care ſhe took in Cultivating this hopeful Plant, by Piouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly managing her firſt Years, (in which all things that are tender and pretious, are moſt of all in danger) was abundantly rewarded by a ſecond bleſſing of another Daughter, Born upon the 15th. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1653. and Chriſtned the 20th. receiving in Baptiſm, the Name of <hi>Suſan,</hi> from my Lady <hi>Hanmer</hi> her Grand-mother, and God-mother. Theſe early Impreſſions of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe gave to both, were ſo pleaſing to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as well as profitable to them; that without doubt they conduc'd very much, to their embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of that State, they now both happily enjoy, in the <hi>English</hi> Monaſtry, of the Order of Saint <hi>Bennet</hi> at <hi>Dunkirck.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She was not only thus diligent in her Duty to her Children, but held the ſame Managery in her Houſhold Affairs of leſs moment. Firſt, as ſoon as ſhe got up in the Morning, having ſpent half an hour at her Devotions in her Cloſet,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56701:21"/>(which ſhe alſo did conſtantly before ſhe went to Bed) ſhe apply'd her ſelf wholy to her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick concerns; and chearfully underwent the trouble of taking an exact account of all things, that were brought in, or ſpent in the Houſe that Day: And thô there was a Steward, whoſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment it was to look into ſuch Affairs; yet ſhe would needs eaſe him of this trouble, and take it upon her ſelf; that he might have more Time to mind other buſineſs of greater moment. 'Tis true, ſhe had no ſtint preſcrib'd her, and might Command of the Steward what Mony ſhe pleas'd, yet to diſpatch all things in a more quiet and orderly manner, ſhe deſir'd Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> to give a particular allowance, to her ſelf, and Children; he offer'd her a Hundred Pound a Year; this condeſcention was kindly receiv'd, yet her Anſwer was, that Fifty would be ſufficient: Which Summ ſhe manag'd ſo well, as never to exceed it; and yet in the mean time by her pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conduct, maintain'd her ſelf and Children, according to their Quality. Neither did this charge or care, any ways hinder her from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiecing to whatſoever Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhould ſay, or do; to whom ſhe always pay'd a moſt humble, and entire ſubmiſſion, as may be gather'd from the following paſſage.</p>
                  <p>It happen'd that Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Unckle, Mr. <hi>Robert VVarner</hi> having an Annuity of Fifty Pounds; had Written a Letter by the Poſt to this effect, that thô there was but half a Year due, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving particular occaſions for Mony, he deſir'd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56701:22"/>that he would advance another half Year, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn him Fifty Pound by the next ſafe opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. This Letter was intercepted, and another counterfited ſo like his own hand, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when it was firſt ſent him; thought it had been his own; till he had read it, and found the Contents different from what he Writ: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of returning the Mony, the Cheat had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd it ſhould be paid to the Bearer, a friend of his; that had furniſh'd him with it; and that he would give him a kind Entertainment for his ſake. The Cheat coming very well Horſt, and very Gentiely Clad, pretending he had ſent his Servant back to the next Market Town, to enquire after a Silver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilted Sword, he had loſt out of his Belt upon the way, with order to expect his return thither the next Day: Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> doubted not in the leaſt his Honeſty, thô my Lady more quick ſighted, ſo far ſuſpected him, as to deſire Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> not to give him the Mony, without Writing again to his Unckle. But the Hand being ſo well counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited, and the Seal of his Coat of Arms alſo; he told her he was ſure 'twas his Unckles Letter, and therefore order d the Steward to pay him the Mony: And when afterwards the Cheat was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover d, ſhe was ſo far from cenſuring Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Action, or from ſaying, <hi>If he had believ'd her, be had ſav'd his Mony;</hi> that ſhe never ſo much as took the leaſt notice of it to him; which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that thô ſhe took great care of what Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> committed to her, yet ſhe did not in the leaſt intermedle, or concern her ſelf in what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56701:22"/>immediatly to his managment; but left it intirely to him, to act as he thought beſt: And as ſhe perform'd all things belonging to her charge, to his extraordinary ſatisfaction; ſo ſhe was no leſs ſubmiſſive to all his Orders: And leſt ſhe might diminiſh that ſatisfaction, ſhe deſir'd he ſhould have in all things, ſhe would even diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve her own Judgment, when in any thing it contradicted his. Neither did her compliance with Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>'s deſires, cauſe her any ways to neglect her Domeſtic Affairs; amongſt which, the care of her Servants was the firſt. Her endeavors were reſtleſs in preventing thoſe diſorders, which are incident to Families; She warned often, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd thoſe who were addicted to unneceſſary, and dangerous Converſations; if theſe admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions prevailed little, ſhe us'd more efficacious means, of hindring ſuch ill conſequences as might follow; by turning away one of them ſhe thought the occaſion, of the others breaking her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. If ſhe found any of her Servants over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen in Drink, She admoniſh'd him the firſt time, to take care ſhe ſaw him not guilty of the ſame fault again; if this charitable advice took no effect, ſhe was wont to uſe her powerful interceſſion with Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> (who refus'd her nothing ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi'd) to diſcharge him immediatly from his ſervice. Moreover, to prevent that common Topic, which Servants for the moſt part make uſe of for an excuſe, that their intemperance proceeds from their kind entertainment of other Gentlemens Servants; She declar'd, that ſhould not ſerve their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56701:23"/>turn; for ſhe deſir'd that others Servants ſhould be treated, as ſhe would have her own; <hi>Viz.</hi> That they ſhould want nothing, yet not have ſo much as to make them unfit to render due ſervice to their Maſters.</p>
                  <p>This care was follow'd by a diligent forecaſt, that no part of that pretious time, She ſo much eſteem'd, might be caſt away, or ſpent idely, but rather improv'd. Ladies ordinarily challenge the time of Dreſſing and Adorning themſelves, as properly their own; and endeavor to make it the whole Employment of their Servants. But on the contrary, She to redeem that, which others do not account loſt; was accuſtom'd to Read conſtantly ſome Devout Book to them; not only when they were buſy in this Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but in the Afternoon alſo; cauſing ſuch, whoſe Circumſtances would permit them, to Work in her preſence; that ſhe might Read to them whilſt they were there: And took care not only to give them all, a conſtant Employment; but alſo, that whilſt their Hands were at Work, their Minds might be Piouſly taken up, with Attention to what they Heard.</p>
                  <p>This care in regulating, and framing her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily according to the Maxims of Chriſtian Duty; thô it was great and ſingular, yet it was too narrow a Sphere, to bound or limit her Charity; which extended not only to Domeſticks, but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the neceſſitous ſtate of all, eſpecially of thoſe who were helpleſs and laden with afflictions: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56701:23"/>as ſhe could never look upon any in miſery or diſtreſs; but ſhe conſider'd their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as her own, and gave them ſpeedy ſuccour and aſſiſtance. And that ſhe mighr do this the better; She would never be enduc'd by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, to Play for Mony; profeſſing, She had none to looſe, but what belong'd to the Poor. For what ſhe could ſpare out of that allowance Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> had given her, She had aſſign'd them; and was ſo ſparing and provident, as to give very conſiderable Alms out of it. She took ſpecial care that the Poor, who came at Dinner Time ſhould be duly ſerv'd; ordering that when any particular Object of Charity preſented it ſelf, they ſhould give her notice of it; and ſhe never fail'd to relieve them proportionably to their neceſſities. If any Neighbor fell ſick, She was not content to ſend them, Cordial Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Syrups, and ſuch like helps, which ſhe had prepar'd for that end; but would be the Bearer of them her ſelf; and by that means, ſee if they wanted not more, than their Modeſty permitted them to ask. Nor was the greateſt difficulty able to obſtruct any Act of Charity towards them: As may appear by her going once half a Mile on Foot, to aſſiſt a Poor Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor in Child-bed, and this even at Midnight, in the rigid ſeaſon of Winter; thrô the Snow, by which ſhe ſaved the Womans Life, who had not my Lady come, had certainly died in Labor, as the perſon her ſelf own'd as long as ſhe liv'd. She had a very Compaſſionate
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56701:24"/>Nature, which ſhe us'd to blame as Cowardize, becauſe it would not permit her to dreſs the Wounds, and Sores of thoſe, for whom ſhe was ſo tenderly concern'd; yet ſhe ſupply'd this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as much as ſhe was able, by giving them ſuch Playſters, and Oyntments, as ſhe made for all ſorts of Aylements: Nor was ſhe leſs curious in having at hand all kinds of approv'l Remedies; that ſhe might impart them to the moſt indigent; and at the ſame time ſo careful, that ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted none into her Receipt Book, which had not produc'd the effect ſhe earneſtly wiſhed.</p>
                  <p>But her Charity ſhin'd moſt of all, where now a days 'tis moſt wanting, <hi>Viz.</hi> in her Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was ſo agreeable an Entertainment to thoſe ſhe Converſt with, that they rather fear'd, than deſir'd it ſhould be interrupted, by any other; it being no leſs ſolid than recreative, and ever ſutable to her Calm and Sweet Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. She knew Judiciouſly how to ſuit her ſelf to thoſe ſhe convers'd with; without any offence, either to the preſent, or abſent; joyning always ingenuity with inſtruction: For being well Read in Hiſtory (that being her chief delight) and having an extraordinary Memory, that made what ſhe had ſeen or Read her own; She never wanted excellent matter to entertain even long Diſcourſes; and was never driven, to ſeek it at others coſt; either by traducing their Actions, or relating any thing that might leſſen their eſteem; but on the contrary, took every occaſion ſhe could, of ſpeaking well of all, and turning every thing,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56701:24"/>by a Pious Artifice, to the beſt ſenſe: Excuſing the intention, if ſhe could not approve of the action; and conſequently never employ'd her Wit in Rallying, or Aſperſing others; bur on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if any one laſht forth into leſs Charitable Inſinuations, She was the firſt, that ſhewed a diſlike by her ſilence; and thereby gave them a kind check to be more wary hereafter: Joyning as I ſaid before, Severity and Affability in ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a manner; that love and fear ſeem'd to go hand in hand; and as the one made her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany deſir'd, ſo the other render'd it not uneaſie: All being willing to quit any Subject, thô never ſo ſuitable to their own humors, rather than looſe the diverſion of hers: And therefore, when any had been declaiming againſt, or cenſuring others, or talking of any light and unprofitable thing; which is the Theme commonly of Worldly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: Her preſence as well before, as after her Marriage, was of ſufficient Authority to ſilence them; and Mrs. <hi>Trevor Hanmer,</hi> or my Lady <hi>VVarner</hi> is coming, was a forcible Item to turn the hoteſt Diſcourſe, into ſuch an one, as might not be diſpleaſing to her. Which evidenc'd how far they were from regretting the interruption of their own Diſcourſe, and how glad of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of enjoying her's, which was ever diverting and innocent.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The firſt beginning and occaſion of her Converſion.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ALmighty God, who diſpoſeth all things no leſs effectually than ſweetly, would no longer permit one, who had liv'd up ſo ſtrictly to the light of Nature and Education, to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the light of Grace. The beginning of her Converſion was after this manner. Her Father Sir <hi>Thomas Hanmer</hi> thought a diverſion for her very neceſſary; and therefore, invited Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> and her, with their whole Family, to Winter with him at <hi>Betisfield.</hi> Whether, as ſoon as ſhe had recover'd her ſtrength, after her Lying-in of her Youngeſt Daughter, they began their Journy. Her diverſion was Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s deſign, in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation; but her Converſion was intended by Higher Powers; nor can this be reflected upon without a ſpecial Adoration of the ſecret Councils of Divine Providence. In this ſejornment it was, ſhe firſt began to doubt of her Religion; which is commonly the firſt ſtep, that God makes uſe of, to bring thoſe that are not in it, to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true one. Hitherto ſhe thought her ſelf in ſo ſecure a way to Salvation, that her Brother's kind and earneſt intreaties of her, to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56701:26"/>leave it, could (as we have ſaid,) work nothing upon her; and was ſo conſtant in it, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could make her think of a change, but the hopes (as we have ſaid) of a Religious Life; to which ſhe often found ſo violent an impulſe, that even permited her not to reflect upon the Abjuration of Proteſtancy, which it neceſſarily requir'd: Otherwiſe the difference in ſo Eſſential a Point, as the Real Preſence in the Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, would have ſtartled her, and put an end to her Deſign of being a Nun; as it did ſurprize her when ſhe heard this was the Belief the Church of <hi>England</hi> Profeſs'd: of which ſhe hitherto acknowledg'd her ſelf a Member.</p>
                  <p>One Night after Supper it happen'd, that my Lady <hi>Hanmer</hi> in a Diſcourſe about Religion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, <hi>That the Belief of the Real Preſence, of our Savior in the Bleſſed Sacrament, was acknowledg'd by the Public Liturgy of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>which was Authoriz'd and Commanded to be Read, in all Churches of the Kingdom.</hi> My Lady <hi>VVarner</hi> ſurpriz'd at this Aſſertion, Modeſtly reply d; <hi>Then Madam I have hitherto been very ignorant in the Religion I Profeſs, and have been brought up in from a Child.</hi> My Lady perſiſted ſtill in her Aſſertion, and admit'd her ignorance in ſo conſiderable a Point of Faith; and Sir <hi>Thomas Hanmer</hi> affirming my Lady to be in the right, and his Daughter to be in an Error, She was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly perplext; to think She had been ſo long brought up, in the Belief of that Tenet, which the Church, ſhe Profeſs'd her ſelf of, diſown'd; fearing, that as ſhe was ignorant in this ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56701:27"/>a Point of Faith, She might be ſo alſo, in others no leſs Eſſential. However, thô ſhe could not ſubmit her Judgment even to her Father's, whoſe knowledge and experience ſhe knew to be far greater than her own; and that his kindneſs alſo was too great, to lead her into an Error (ſo deep are the impreſſions of Education, as not eaſily to be canceld) yet ſhe prudently ſeem'd to acquieſce to their Opinion, rather than farther contradict them, and ſuſpended her Judgment, till ſhe could better inform her ſelf, in ſo important a Point; which ſhe intended to do at <hi>London.</hi> Which place (after S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>She no ſooner came to <hi>London,</hi> but Sir <hi>Iohn Hanmer</hi> her Brother came to Viſit her; and told her, her Unckle <hi>Hanmer</hi> (a Title the <hi>VVelsh</hi> give to ſuch as are Couſins only, when they much exceed them in Age) was in Town, and would be very glad to ſee her. This was that Father of the <hi>Society of Ieſus</hi> above mention'd, with whom ſhe had treated about being Religious. She was at firſt a little concern'd, about what he would think of her, for having embrac'd a State of Life, ſo contrary to what ſhe had propos'd to him; but Civility overcoming this apprehenſion, She appointed a time to receive his intended Viſit; which he made at the time prefixt, and was ſo far from taking notice of what ſhe apprehended, that he Congratulated with her, for her happy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; but neglected not to take this occaſion of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56701:27"/>ſpeaking to her of Religion; of the neceſſity of being in the true Church; that there was but one that could be true; there being but one Faith, as there was but one God, and one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; and deſir'd her no leſs for her own, than for his ſake, to take the pains only, of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning impartially the Tenets of both Churches; and ſhe would ſoon find which was the true one. She could not, but make a Civil acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his kind concern; which gave him hopes, that a ſecond Viſit would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome; whereby he thought he might be able, to do good upon a Soul, he found ſo well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to hear reaſon; perceiving her neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd, nor byaſ d with paſſion, or prejudice: Two of the greateſt impediments in the way to Truth.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond time he went to Viſit her, he took occaſion to Diſcourſe upon the particular Tenets of the Roman Catholic Religion; having in the firſt only toucht them in general; and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Points, he diſcourſt moſt at large upon the Real Preſence: For which thô he brought more and better Arguments, than ever ſhe had heard; yet they only wrought upon her ſo far, as to quicken her in the performance of the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe had before taken, of being better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, in a Point of ſuch conſequence; aſſented to by her own, as well as the Roman Catholic Church; thô hitherto ſhe had believ'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.

                  <p>
                     <q>Being firſt acquainted with the end of our coming, the Doctor deſir'd me to propoſe my difficulties; I asked him, what was the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant opinion concerning the Sacrament? He told me, that the Body of our Saviour was really there; and that it was Eaten by us, with our Teeth. I asked him about Praying to Saints? He told me, 'twas a thing indifferent. I asked him about Purgatory? He ſaid, it was an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion grounded upon reaſon, and that he was not much againſt it. I asked him about Confeſſion? He told me 'twas a neceſſary, and uſeful thing, and that it was ever practis'd in the Proteſtant Church, and that he himſelf had receiv'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, all along the troubleſome Times. I asked him about Merit? He told me 'twas as the Roman Catholic Church had Defin'd it; but that Proteſtants durſt not uſe the word,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56701:29"/>for fear of offending the Common People, thô their meaning in that Point was the ſame with the Catholics. He told me, he agreed to all that the Catholic Councils had Decreed, and that what they had not determin'd, he medled not with. He offer'd to bring me to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canturbury</hi> Dr. <hi>Sheldon,</hi> to be aſſur'd, that this was not his own Opinion or particular Belief, but that the whole Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church believ'd the ſame. He ſaid there was no difference between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and Church of <hi>England,</hi> but what might eaſily be Reconcil'd, and that there was no Diſpute about Fundamental Points of Faith. Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that he had lately Diſcours'd with his Grace the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canturbury</hi> about theſe Points, with the ſame freedom, he had done with me; and that the Biſhop told him, <hi>Doctor I am of your Opinion.</hi>

                  <p>My Lady was ſurpriz'd to hear theſe Opinions ſo frequently Rail'd at, by thoſe of her own Church, now in a manner own'd by a Doctor of the ſame; and as Dr. <hi>Buck</hi> affirm'd, even by the Primat of it, the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canturbury</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And afterwards declar'd, <hi>That this Diſcourſe of his wrought more upon her, than all she could have heard from Catholics could ever have done; and was above meaſure troubl'd to ſee her ſelf ſo ignorant at that Age, in Points of Religion, of ſo great moment; and to find her ſelf ſo unſetl'd in her Faith, as to doubt whether her own, or the Roman Catholic Religion, were the beſt.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Kinaſton</hi> eaſily perceiv'd my Lady's perplexity,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56701:29"/>and was no leſs troubl'd herſelf; which ſhe could not refrain from expſſing, by theſe following words. <hi>Madam, you were the occaſion, that I heard a Prieſt, and I am ſo unfortunate, as to have brought you to Diſcourſe with a Ieſuit,</hi> meaning the Doctor, who notwithſtanding liv'd and dy'd a Profeſſed Proteſtant of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This trouble and diſquiet my Lady found in her mind after this Diſcourſe, forc'd her to ſend to Father <hi>Hanmer,</hi> to beg of him the favor of a Third Viſit, which he moſt readily granted; and when he came, ſhe told him what had paſs'd, and the effects of the Conference with Dr. <hi>Buck; Viz. That her Belief, of which was the True Religion, was wavering, and unſetl'd; and that she was ſo reſtleſs and diſquieted thereby, that she fear'd whether or no she was of any Religion at all; and that if she dy'd in this doubting condition, she knew not what would become of her.</hi> And with all told him, <hi>That she was immediatly going out of Town, and by that means should not have the opportunity of confering with him any more, about a matter of ſo great Importance as this was, upon which her Eternal Happineſs depended; wherefore, she beg'd of him to continue his kindneſs for her, he had hitherto ſo much expreſt both by his words and actions, in ſending ſome friend of his to her Houſe at</hi> Parham, <hi>whether she was going the next Day; to whom she might propoſe her difficulties, and by his aſſiſtance regain that repoſe of mind she poſſeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this accident happen'd.</hi> The Father promis'd to ſend one to her; <hi>And deſir'd her, not to diſturb her ſelf in the mean time; told her that God had occaſion'd this
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56701:30"/>Tempeſt in her Soul for her advantage, who in a short time would Calm the Storm he had rais'd, if she had recourſe to him with a filial and unshaken confidence; and that his VViſdom would help and direct her wavering judgment into the right way; but deſir'd her alſo to take great care leſt Paſsion or Intereſt should interpoſe, and hinder, or divert his Divine Operations in her Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A fortnight after her return to <hi>Parham,</hi> Father <hi>Hanmer</hi> fail'd not to perform his promiſe; and ſent one Father <hi>Iohn Travers</hi> of the <hi>Society of Ieſus,</hi> with a Letter to my Lady, to ſignifie, <hi>That the bearer of it was ſuch a friend of his, as she had deſir'd him to ſend to her; who would give her all the ſatisfaction she could poſsibly wish for.</hi> She receiv'd him, as Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> did alſo, with all reſpect and kindneſs ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable; thô Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> was all this while ignorant of what had paſs'd at <hi>London,</hi> but had taken notice and was much troubl'd to ſee my Lady was more Melancholy ſince her return home than ordinary, which he ſuppos'd proceeded from leaving her Father, whom ſhe as paſſionatly lov'd, as he did her; and only knew that this Gentleman was a friend and acquaintance of he Unckle <hi>Hanmer,</hi> who he knew had Viſited her ſeveral times whilſt ſhe was in <hi>London.</hi>

                  <p>My Lady had ſeveral Diſcourſes with Father <hi>Travers,</hi> in which he gave her ſo evident an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Truth of the Roman Catholic Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that ſhe reſolv'd, forthwith to embrace it; and was in pain till ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>dge of the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Faith, and ſuch convincing Reaſons of the Truth of it, that she no longer doubted there was any other way to Salvation, than by making her ſelf a Member of the Roman Catholic Church. Sir</hi> John <hi>deſir'd her not to be too rash in her Reſolutions;</hi> telling her, <hi>That often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a too precepitous Zeal, is apt to out-run reaſon and diſcretion, and make Reſolutions otherways good, to become Abortive; that too great heat is an hinderance from bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing to prefection;</hi> and then added, <hi>How uncomfortable a thing it would be for them, to be of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Religions; that he had a Soul to ſave as well as she, and that no Temporal Intereſt, or loſs of Reputation, should hinder him from doing, what was neceſſary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Salvation: That he was troubled no leſs than her ſelf was, upon what she had related, and aſſur'd her that he would not reſt ſatisfied, till he was throughly convinc'd, which of the two Religions was the trueſt; and that perhaps after a diligent enquiry, he might be of the ſame mind with her, and that 'twould be moſt comfortable to both, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the ſame Religion together. But he believ'd this Gentleman would not be able to Anſwer ſuch difficulties, as he would propoſe to him concerning the Roman Catholic Faith; which if he could not, she would then have

                  <p>The next Morning Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> not doubting but that the difficulties he had to propoſe were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable; accoſts the Gentleman, who hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly Eluded all Queſtions, that might occaſion a Diſpute in Religion. Which Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving told him, <hi>That he wonder'd he shew'd not the ſame Zeal for his Soul, that he had expreſs'd for his VVives, and did not give him the ſame ſatisfaction in his doubts, that he found he had given her in hers.</hi> The Gentleman perceiving that my Lady had inform'd Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> of all that had paſt, <hi>deſir'd him to propoſe his difficulties;</hi> which he had no ſooner done, but the Gentleman ſo eaſily and clearly anſwer'd them, that Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> was aſtoniſh'd, and had nothing to reply to his Anſwers, they being ſo clear and convincing. Amongſt other things Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, <hi>what rational grounds there could be for a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Purgatory?</hi> Hereupon, he ſolidly explicated them, ſhewing the difference between the guilt of Puniſhment, and guilt of Offence, by the Example of <hi>David,</hi> who after the Pardon of his Tranſgreſſion, had the Puniſhment of it inflicted upon him, by the Death of his Child; and ſo ingeniouſly Moraliz'd upon God's Infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56701:32"/>and mercy, that would not permit him to Damn a Soul for one ſmall Offence, no more than his Juſtice would ſuffer any thing that was defil'd to enter into Heaven; and therefore, requir'd either a Voluntary Pennance or Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be undergone in this Life, or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary Puniſhment to be ſuffer'd in the next, to purifie ſuch a Soul; and thereby render it fit for Heaven; and alſo clearly Explicated the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a Voluntary ſatisfaction made for Sin in this Life, and a neceſſary undergoing the Puniſhment inflicted for it in the next; and how much more acceptable the one muſt needs be to God, than the other; and that therefore a ſmall Pennance perform'd in this World, was able to ſatisfie more, than many Years great ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings could do in the next: The one being freely and willingly undertaken, the other ſuffer'd by force.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> at the end of this Diſcourſe found himſelf ſo ſenſibly toucht by it, that he could not refrain from telling him, <hi>That were he convinc'd, there was a Purgatory (as he should be, were he once a Roman Catholic) he would uſe the beſt means he could to avoid it; and he thought none better than to betake himſelf to a Religious courſe of Life; the Roman Catholic Church affording this means of avoiding it, having many Religious Houſes; whether ſuch as perceiv'd the great danger the VVorld expos'd to, and the little ſatisfaction it gave, might retire themſelves, as to a ſecure Harbor; which happineſs his own Religion wanted.</hi> The Gentleman as at firſt he had been backward in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56701:32"/>engaging in any Diſcourſe concerning Religion, now ſeem'd very active in diſcouraging Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> from ſuch an undertaking; telling him, <hi>That this was not nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>That which Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> acknowledg'd himſelf moſt ſurpriz'd at, was that he found the chief things objected againſt Roman Catholics, and which he thought impoſſible for the other to Anſwer, were
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56701:33"/>either falſe, or falſly repreſented. As that of Idolatry, of Merit, of forgiving Sins before hand, or giving leave to Sin, and ſeveral ſuch like Tenets laid to their charge. The Gentleman promis'd in a ſhort time, to bring him what he deſir'd, and the very Day he went from <hi>Parham</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> reſolv'd to ſet upon what he had advis'd him; <hi>Viz.</hi> by entring into a ſerious Recollection, ponder, and thereby diſcover, of how great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance it was to be in the right way to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and how little it ſignified to enjoy never ſo great happineſs in this ſhort Life, if after it one loſt an Eternal felicity, in the next. He therefore moſt earneſtly beg'd of Almighty God to direct him into that ſecure way, that leads to Bliſs, and which himſelf came into this World to Chalk out; that by the knowledge of it in this Life, he might obtain the Fruits of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable Redemption in the Life to come. Whilſt he proceeded in theſe Pious Exerciſes, it pleas'd God Almighty to bring into his Mind ſome good thoughts he had entertain'd, not long before, in a very dangerous Sickneſs, <hi>Viz.</hi> of the uncertainty he was then in, of his future happineſs, and what horror he ſelt from thence; what deſires and reſolutions he then conceiv'd in his Soul, of living a more Virtuous Life; if God ſhould vouchſafe to prolong it. A Dream alſo, which carried his conſideration ſtill further, came freſh into his Memory, which he had had not long before, of his being ready to receive the Sentence of Eternal Damnation, before the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56701:33"/>Grand Tribunal; and how much he then wiſht, that he might return again to the World, to make ſatisfaction by a new Life, for his paſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. Alſo, how inſignificant all the pleaſures and ſatisfactions of this World then appear'd, and how willingly he would have Sacrific'd them all, to have freed himſelf from the Eternal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, in which he even ſeem'd already to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd.</p>
                  <p>Theſe thoughts were ſo lively repreſented unto him, and were ſo urgent and weighty, that they mov'd him no leſs now, than they had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, gave him a quicker and ſharper ſenſe of the danger of his preſent condition, and caus'd him to make an intire Oblation of himſelf to Almighty God; begging of him by his Sacred Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to Pardon his paſt Sins, and to teach him hereafter how to Love and Pleaſe him. Another thing alſo came under his deliberation, which had been to him a frequent occaſion of great trouble; <hi>Viz.</hi> The fear and apprehenſion leſt his Lady ſhould die before him: Which he could never think of, without a more than an ordinary ſorrow; judging, it would be impoſſible for him to ſurvive ſo great and ſenſible a loſs. In this perplexity, the ſame thought which repreſented it ſelf, whilſt Father <hi>Travers</hi> explicated the Doctrin of Purgatory, return'd with ſo much violence, yet was accompanied with ſo comfortable a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that it ſeem'd to diſſipate all his former doubts and troubles. A Religious Life offering it ſelf to his ſerious conſiderations, as a means to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56701:34"/>make Death and Judgment (the moſt terrible of all things) comfortable and pleaſant; and that nothing could ſo much diſpoſe him for ſuch a neceſſary ſeparation, as Death would one Day make, between him and his Lady; as a Voluntary ſeparating before hand, for the Love of God.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> was carried away ſo violently with theſe thoughts, that they gave him no liberty at all to reflect upon the change of his Religion; thô ſo neceſſary a Qualification for that State of Life, he was ſo forceably mov'd to embrace; nor could he be ſatisfied, till he had diſcover d them to his Lady; whom if he found, not to have the like inclinations now, which he knew ſhe had before her Marriage, 'twould be in vain for him any longer, to entertain any ſuch thoughts. Therefore, he opens his Mind to her, in order to a Religious State; who receiv'd this intimation with a Flood of Tears; ſeeing her thus mov'd at this propoſal, <hi>He beg'd of her for the Love of God, not to trouble her ſelf farther, about what he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd; for unleſs she were of the ſame Mind, he neither could, nor would harbor theſe thoughts any longer.</hi> She on the other ſide aſſur'd him, <hi>That her Tears were not Tears of ſorrow, as he apprehended them, but of joy, and that the ſame value she had before Marriage for a Religious State, was not at all leſſen'd by it, and that she ſtill eſteem'd a Monaſtical Life the happieſt in this VVorld; but endeavor'd to put ſuch thoughts as much out of her Mind, as she was able; becauſe she had ſettled her ſelf in a Condition ſo oppoſite to that moſt happy Calling: And that she durſt never ſignifie her Mind to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56701:34"/>him in this matter, fearing he might take it as unkindly, as she imagin'd, he thought, she had taken his propoſal.</hi> She added, <hi>That she thought no Courſe of Life could be truly happy, in which the Diſpenſations of Gods Providence were not equally acceptable.</hi> She told him alſo, <hi>That as she was confident she should not, ſo she fear'd he would not enjoy a long Life; and that this was not her Opinion alone, but alſo her Fathers, who for that reaſon was concern'd, that he ſo long defer'd the ſettelement of his Eſtate; according to the Articles agreed upon at their Marriage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> was ſtartl'd, that others ſhould take notice of what he ſo little thought on; and which he had more reaſon to apprehended, then they; and eſteem'd this as a timely admonition from Heaven, to make a Spiritual Proviſion for Eternity. A ſettlement far more worth thinking on, and of greater moment, than any this World could afford. But my Lady went on arguing as Father <hi>Travers</hi> before had done, <q>That a Religious Life they aim'd at, as happy as it was, requir'd ſuch a Diſpoſition as neither of them yet had; <hi>Viz.</hi> The being Members of the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Church, none but that affording the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch a Retirement: And therefore, that they ought firſt to ſatisfie themſelves, and embrace this, before they could partake of the other he had propos'd.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Diſcourſe being ended, Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> retir'd himſelf again to his Cloſet, where he was ſeiz'd with ſo great trouble and anxiety, occaſion'd by the uncertainty he felt, whether he was in the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56701:35"/>true way to Salvation or no; that made him reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: Which diſquiet of Mind was the principal occaſion of ripening his Converſion; and for the fear of what irreparable conſequences might follow; if he were not in the true way, ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no help from any diverſion, he took to eaſe his troubled Mind, thinking the time long, thô but Ten Days ſince Father <hi>Travers</hi> departure; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to go himſelf purpoſly to him to get the Paper he had promis'd him, from which he hop't to receive ſome comfort and ſatisfaction; and found him in a readineſs to begin his Journy for <hi>Parham;</hi> with the Summary or Treatiſe, he had promis'd of the Catholic Doctrin. He beg'd of him not to charge his kind deſign, but to accompany him back to <hi>Parham,</hi> which requeſt he condeſcended to. Where reading the Articles over to Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> his Lady and Siſter, the two laſt were throughly and effectually convinc'd, and reſolv'd to take the opportunity of Father <hi>Travers</hi> preſence, to Reconcile themſelves before his departure, and thereby become Members of the Roman Catholic Church: Which they did upon the Eve of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſts, and Receiv'd the Holy Sacrament the next Day. But Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> reſolv'd to hear what thoſe of his Church would ſay to the Reaſons ſet down in the foreſaid Treatiſe, before he would make any change of Religion.</p>

                     <p>A Relation of Sir <hi>John Warner</hi>'s Converſion, and how both he and his Lady, reſolve to enter upon a Religious courſe of Life.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I Muſt here beg leave of the Reader, to accept of a ſhort Relation of Sir <hi>Iohns</hi> Converſion, together with ſome Motives, which conduced not a little to his change of Religon; becauſe 'twill no leſs inform him, how my Lady by that means was ſet at Liberty, to embrace a Religious State of Life; than diſabuſe ſome perſons, who by miſtake, thought ſuch a ſeparation impoſſible, conſidering their ample Fortune in the World; unleſs ſome diſguſt or diſſatisfaction had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd, on the one ſide or the other; and by this ſhort Narrative, the Rich goodneſs of Almighty God's over-ruling Providence, in drawing Souls to his Service, will alſo evidently appear.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> thô he could not refute thoſe Reaſons Father <hi>Travers</hi> had ſet down; yet thought it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ſuſpend his judgment, and ſubmiſſion to a change of Religion, till he found whether others of his own, could ſolve thoſe Queries, he had heard Read. Wherefore, he obtains leave of Father <hi>Travers,</hi> to ſhow this Treatiſe, to ſome Learned Men of the Proteſtant
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56701:36"/>Church; and for this end, reſolv'd to make a Journy on purpoſe to <hi>London;</hi> and prevail'd with the Father to meet him there; that they might be able to confer about the Objections that others ſhould make, to what he had ſet down in his Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> being in <hi>London,</hi> firſt of all apply'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Dr. <hi>Buck;</hi> with whom (thô he had been Chaplain to his Grand-father, and had Baptiz'd Sir <hi>Iohn;</hi>) he had no Perſonal acquaintance; but found him ſo Civil, as freely to Diſcourſe with him, without asking him who he was. The Doctor Read over the whole Treatiſe with Sir <hi>Iohn.</hi> and made no Objection, either againſt the Real Preſence, Prayer to Saints, Purgatory, Confeſſion, or Satisfaction for Sins. But when he came to that Point; that there was no true Oridination, or Prieſt-hood in the Proteſtant Church; (for a proof whereof, was alleadg'd, what Dr. <hi>Thomdike</hi> in his <hi>VVeights and Meaſures</hi> wiſht; <q>That ſince there was a great doubt in ſo Eſſential a Point, they would ſubmit to a Re-ordination by the Suftra; an Biſhops of Rome)</q> the Doctor was ſo mov'd, that he declar'd, <hi>the Author of that Pamphlet deſerv'd a ſevere Punishment.</hi> And when Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> endeavor'd to pacifie the Doctor, telling him, <q>His Citation was out of a Proteſtant Author, and therefore, unleſs falſe was not ſo much to be blam'd;</q> yet the Doctor could not be perſwaded to Read any further; which when Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> perceiv'd, he deſir'd the Doctor, <hi>That he would voughſafe at leaſt to inform him, ſince there was a doubt in the Proteſtant Church,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56701:36"/>of a Point of ſo great conſequence, as that of True Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was: VVhether there could be any danger of his Salvation, if for this reaſon; as well as for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Religious Houſes, which the Proteſtant Church wanted, (finding himſelf moſt particularly mov'd to a Religious State of Life,) he should quit the Proteſtant Religion, he was Ered up in, to become a Member of the Roman Catholic Church?</hi> The Doctor here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt his concern, that there wanted ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency in the Proteſtant Religion, which the Roman Catholic had, but would not own a want of Ordination; but ſtill invey'd againſt the Author of that Aſſertion, and earneſtly perſwaded Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> to continue in the Church he was in, which was very good, and had in it all things neceſſary to Salvation; aſſuring him, <q>That in a ſhort time they would both be United. The chief difference betwixt them, conſiſting in the Popes Uſurping a Power, beyond what Chriſt had given him: Their Church allowing him to be Queſtion, he believ'd would ſoon be decided, by a Condeſcention on both ſides.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> was not ſatisfied with this Anſwer, but reſolv'd to go to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canturbury</hi> Dr. <hi>Sheldon,</hi> he being the Primat of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church; whom Dr. <hi>Buck</hi> had alſo cited, to be of his Opinion. And that he might not be too troubleſome to his Grace, he reduc'd what he intended to propoſe to him, to Three Queries.</p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:56701:37"/>
                  <p>The Firſt, <hi>VVhether there were a Church Eſtablish'd by Chriſt, out of which there was no Salvation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second. <hi>VVhether the Roman Catholic Church were a Member of this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Third. <hi>VVhether there was Salvation in the Roman Catholic Church?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> came to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and asked to ſpeak with my Lord, he would not give him Audience, before he ſent in his Name, which he barely gave, concealing his Quality. To the firſt of his Queſtions my Lord Anſwer'd <hi>Aſſirmitively;</hi> to the ſecond, he ſaid <hi>it was a corrupted Member;</hi> whereupon Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> asked him, <hi>if it Err'd in any Fundamental Point?</hi> He Anſwer'd, <hi>it did not, for then it would be no Church;</hi> hence out of the premiſes granted by my Lord, Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> drew this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in Anſwer to his Third Query; telling my Lord, <hi>That then it evidently follow'd, there was Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in the Roman Catholic Church.</hi> But my Lord told him, <hi>That for thoſe who were Born and Bred up in the Roman Catholic Religion, there might be Salvation; but for him who own'd himſelf to be Educated a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, it was very doubtful; it being very dangerous to leave apure Church, to enter into one defil'd with Errors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which when Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> out of his own words reply'd, <hi>That they not erring in Fundamental Points, he humbly conceiv'd it could not be ſo dangerous, as his Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56701:37"/>but having underſtood from Dr. <hi>Buck,</hi> the eſteem my Lord had for a Religious State; from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, the Doctor told him, his Grace had one Day let fall, as he was puting on his Canonical Robes in the Lobby, to go into the Parlament-Houſe: (Viz <hi>How happy it would be, did their Church afford ſuch a conveniency, as the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>did; that Brothren might dwell together in Vnity; and what a comfort their Converſations would be, to each other</hi>) reſolv'd to propoſe the an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Here my Lord was interrupted by a Youth of about Ten Years of Age, his Relation, who was going to <hi>VVeſtminſter</hi>-School, with whom my
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56701:38"/>Lord entertain'd himſelf ſo conſiderable a time, in asking him, <hi>VVhat Books he learnt? How this and the other of his Friends did?</hi> And ſuch like Queſtions; as gave Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> who ſat by, juſt Reaſon to think, that the danger of becoming Catholic, was not ſo great as my Lord affirm'd; otherwiſe he would have thought his time better ſpent in ſatisfying him, in a buſineſs of ſo great conſequence, than in converſing with the other, about matters of leſs moment.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, either unwilling to give himſelf father trouble, or believing it might diſguſt Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> to ſee him triflle away his time thus with this Youth, inſtead of endeavoring to clear his doubts; and perhaps willing enough to break of the Diſcourſe, for fear he might not be able to give him intire ſatisfaction; told him, <hi>That ſince his weighty affairs allow'd him not, ſo much time, as the anſwering his doubts requir'd; he would recommend him to one, who should make it his buſineſs to do it;</hi> and therefore called one of his Gentlemen, and Commanded him, <hi>to go along with Sir</hi> John <hi>to Dr.</hi> Dolbin (<hi>then Dean of</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Bishop of</hi> Rocheſter, <hi>and laſt of all of</hi> York) <hi>and in his Name deſire the Dean, to render him what ſervice was in his Power, in the buſineſs he came about.</hi>

                  <p>Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> went according to his appointment, and was immediatly introduc'd into his Cloſet; where Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> perceiving, both by the Doctors endeavors, to prevent his propoſing his doubts; as well, as by anſwering thoſe he had propos'd to my Lord, much after the ſame manner as his Grace had done, that he was not like to have the ſatisfaction he expected; made few or no Objections to what he ſaid; thinking it better to go away quietly, as in appearance ſatisfied; than otherwiſe give occaſion of diſſatisfaction, both to the Arch-biſhop and the Doctor; and thereby cauſe them to divulge, what few knew of; to wit, the diſquiet and uneaſineſs he found in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion.

                  <p>As ſoon as he had made this Reſolution, he began to find ſome Interior repoſe, and quiet in his Soul: Which from his firſt ſuſpition or doubt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56701:39"/>of the truth of the Religion he Profeſs'd, was continually upon the Rack; eſpecially during the time he was at <hi>London;</hi> and it had ſo influenc'd his Health, that he fear'd, by the Indiſpoſition he found himſelf in, that ſome violent Sickneſs would follow. Which in a Letter he gave his Lady notice of; at which ſhe was ſo concern'd, as to haſten immediatly to <hi>London</hi> on Horſe-back, concluding he might be worſe, than he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs in his Letter, for fear of troubling her. But Providence order'd this for their mutual ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, that ſhe might be preſent at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception into the Roman Catholic Church, he having appointed the next Morning after her arrival, to meet with Father <hi>Travers</hi> for that end. She though ſo troubleſome a Journy well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compens'd, by becoming a Spectator of what ſhe chiefly wiſh'd, and Pray'd for. And when he told her, that ſince his Reſolutions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling himſelf to the Roman Catholic Church, he began to receive again that quiet and repoſe of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd, he had loſt from the firſt time he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to doubt of his own Religion: She reply'd, <q>That ſhe had experienc'd the ſame; but that 'twas nothing in compariſon of the comfortand ſatisfaction, ſhe enjoy'd after her Reconciliation; which was accompany'd with ſuch an aſſurance, of her being in a ſecure way to Eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that ſhould Father <hi>Travers</hi> Renouce the Religion, ſhe had embrac'd by his Inſtruction and advice; (who had been ſo Inſtrumental in this her Converſion) yet this change in him
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56701:40"/>would not move, or trouble her in the leſt; or give her the leſt doubt or diſeſteem of what ſhe now Profeſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> was Reconcil'd the Sixth of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1664. and afterwards experienc'd ſuch a Tranſport and Security in his Soul, as his Lady had given him hopes of; and 'tis impoſſible for any one to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, what this is; but thoſe that have felt it. The doing of this was a neceſſary means for Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>'s executing his other Deſign, of leaving the World; which the Devil (ſince he had no ſucceſs in hindering the former) reſolv'd now to try to prevent; foreſeeing that a Religious State would be no leſs beneficial, to theſe happy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelites in their way to Heaven, than what they had already done: And therefore, endeavor'd what he could, to repreſent and magnifie to him the preſent happineſs, he enjoy'd in the World, in ſo incomparable a Wife, ſo good an Eſtate, and ſo handſome and convenient a Houſe; which he had juſt finiſh'd and furniſh'd at great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences; and as yet had not receiv'd the leaſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from it, for the pains he had taken, and trouble and charges he had been at, in building it. Alſo, how impoſſible it would be, to find any comfort or ſatisfaction, after the leaving ſo good and kind a Conſort, the ſeparation from whom he would never be able to ſurvice; how difficult it would likewiſe be, to obſerve what was neceſſary in that state he aim'd at, Perpetual Continency, Poverty, and Obedience. But God's Grace ſtill aſſiſted him with reaſons to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56701:40"/>Anſwer theſe Objections. Firſt, That (as Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> took notice at his firſt coming to <hi>Parham</hi>) that thô indeed he was as happy, as he could wiſh to be at preſent, yet what he added, <hi>If it would laſt always;</hi> as it then ſtruck him, ſo now the conſideration, how tranſitory this happineſs was, helped him to over-come theſe Temptations; to which alſo this ſeaſonable conſideration did not a little contribute. <hi>Viz.</hi> That if he refus'd to follow God's Call, he might thereby provoke him, to deprive him of what he chiefly took a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in, as a juſt puniſhment for that Ingratitude, and thereby make him as well miſerable in this World, as in the next; for refuſing to reſtore to God, what he ſo liberally had beſtow'd upon him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe thoughts renew'd his good deſires, and made him again purpoſe to return to God what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had given, and what he valued above all his other Benefits his LADY: To whom he thought he could not ſhow a greater Mark of his kindneſs; than to forgoe the greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſatisfaction he had in this World, for her greater happineſs and contentment in the next. Nor did he think it a ſufficient compliance with God's Call, to leave the World (as the Devil would have perſwaded him was enough) if ſhe chanced to die firſt; becauſe then the living in it, would have been a trouble to him, and would be nothing elſe but to Conſecrate that to God which he was weary of; and therefore, could not be ſo acceptable a Sacrifice, as now it would.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56701:41"/>Beſides, it was as probable ſhe might as well out live him, as he her; and then it would be out of his Power to ſhew any Correſpondence at all to Gods Inſpitation. Wherefore, he ſet a new, upon bringing about the deſign of embracing a Religious State; and finding his Ladies Inclinations intenſly the ſame, propos'd to her (as a tryal of what they were afterwards to practice) that for the time they ſhould live together in the World, they ſhould live as they muſt do when ſeparated, not as Man and Wife, but as Brother and Siſter: Thô to avoid giving occaſions of ſuſpition, and leſt theſe their reſolutions ſhould too ſoon take Air; they would continue to live together, as to outward appearance, in the ſame manner as before.</p>
                  <p>Thus they liv'd from the 6th. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> till the 27th. of <hi>October,</hi> and God as a Teſtimony of the Truth of their Vocations, took away all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, that is in a ſtrict Obſervance of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency; even amidſt the continual occations to the contrary. Which wounderful effects ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> that theſe deſires were from God; that he reſolv'd ſpeedily to diſpoſe things for his going beyond-Sea, by a ſettlement of his Eſtate. In Order to which he ſends for his Brother Mr. <hi>Francis VVarner</hi> who was then at <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As ſoon as his Brother came to <hi>Parham,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> diſcover'd his intention to him, that having no Sons, he diſign'd to make him Heir of his Eſtate, paying Portions to each of his Daughters; and that he would make no conditions with him, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56701:41"/>might ſway him to do, what he himſelf was not convinc'd was for the beſt; but only deſir'd in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital of this his kindneſs, that he would do what he had done himſelf; <hi>Viz. Laying aſide both Paſsion and Intereſt,</hi> examine the Principles of both Religions; and upon ſolid Motives embrace that, which he ſhould find the moſt ſecure for his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs: and dayly beg of God by his Sacred Paſſion, that he would direct him into the true way to Salvation, if he were not already in it. Mr. <hi>Francis VVarner</hi> kindly promis'd a grant to Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>'s requeſt, and for this end accompany'd him to <hi>London;</hi> where in purſuit after the Truth, being preſent at a Diſpute between Father <hi>Travers</hi> and Dr. <hi>Chamberline,</hi> then Chaplain to the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> he was ſo convinc'd of the danger of continuing in his own Religion, that he ſoon after Reconcil'd himſelf to the Roman Catholic Church; which action being maturly perform'd, he acknowledg'd to Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he was more oblig'd to him for the manner of giving him the Eſtate; than for the Eſtate it ſelf. For when firſt he diſcover'd his deſign to him, he was ſo poſſeſs'd of the Truth of his own Religion, that had he offer'd to give it him, upon condition to abandon the Proteſtant Religion, which then he thought the beſt; he would ſooner have refus'd the Eſtate, than have forſaken his Religion; and conſequently had never enjoy'd that happineſs, he now experienc'd in his Soul; much beyond his Power to expreſs, and far exceeding, any he could hope for in the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56701:42"/>enjoyment of the Eſtate he had given him.</p>
                  <p>My Lady <hi>VVarner</hi> in the mean time, redoubled her Devotions, and Manifeſted her Zeal, by endeavoring to draw as many as ſhe was able of her Servants and Neighbours, (over whom ſhe had a ſuaſive power) to make themſelves as happy by embracing the Roman Catholic Faith, as ſhe was; and was the cauſe that ſeveral of them became Catholics. Her fervor had ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported her, that ſhe had even worn off the skin of her Knees by Praying, and might have done her ſelf a conſiderable prejudice, had not Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> perſwaded her to put a ſtop to this her great Zeal and fervor.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> prepar'd for his going beyond-ſea, by making a ſettlement of his Eſtate at <hi>London.</hi> She did the like in the Country, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing things in ſuch an order, that as ſoon as he return'd, he might not be hinder'd from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning his Journy. She made an Inventory of all things in, and about the Houſe; that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might be embezl'd by Tenants, or out of the way when call'd for by Mr. <hi>Francis VVarner;</hi> and ſhe had order'd and diſpos'd all things ſo carefully, that Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> at his return, found nothing wanting for the beginning of his Journy. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he with his Lady, Children, and Siſter, left <hi>Parham</hi> the 20th. of <hi>October,</hi> and came to <hi>London</hi> the 23d. where ſhe ſtay'd till the 27th. upon which day my Lady with Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Siſter, Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth VVarner,</hi> and his Kinſwoman Mrs. <hi>Frances Skelton,</hi> his two Children <hi>Catherine</hi> and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56701:42"/>
                     <hi>Suſan,</hi> a Servant, with Mrs. <hi>Fauſſet,</hi> a Woman who knew the Low-Countries, and was accuſtomed to conduct beyond-ſea, young Gentle-women, that went to Monaſtrys, began their Journy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Dover;</hi> but my Lady would no longer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of the Title of Madam, and chang'd her Name into that of <hi>Clare.</hi> As ſoon as they came thither, they found the Pacquet-boat ready to go off, and immediatly Embarqued themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſtay at all at <hi>Dover.</hi> The reaſon why Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> did not accompany them; was becauſe he judg'd it beſt to ſtay privatly in <hi>London,</hi> to ſee what conſequences might follow their departure, and to prevent ſuch ill ones as might enſue.</p>
                  <p>It was a particular Providence they took the firſt opportunity, for no ſooner had they left <hi>London,</hi> but Dr. <hi>Edward VVarner</hi> one of the Kings Phyſitians, and Unckle to Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> heard of it; and procur'd an Order to be ſent to <hi>Dover</hi> from King and Council, for the ſtoping of Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> and his Lady. This came not to the Mayor's Hand, till the Pacquet-boat was put off; ſo that all he could do, was to return Anſwer, that they were gone; believing Mr. <hi>Gaſcoin</hi> a Gentleman, who met them accidentally at <hi>Dover,</hi> and went over in the ſame Pacquet, to be Sir <hi>Iohn;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Mayor ſignified, that he was ſorry the Order came not time enough for him to ſtop them, as otherwiſe he would certainly have done.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>VVarner</hi> upon the ſuppoſition that Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> with his whole Family was gone beyond-ſea;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56701:43"/>endeavour'd to ſecure his Eſtate, ſince he could not him; and therefore, Petition'd the King and Council, for a Grant of it, upon pretext to keep it out of the Joſuits hands; who as he pretended had perſwaded him out of his Eſtate, as well as Religion; and had been the Principal Authors of his raſh undertaking, ſo imprudent a courſe of Life. The King, who lov'd not importunities of that kind, endeavour'd to put him off with a Jeſt, telling him, <hi>If Sir</hi> John <hi>had a mind to make himſelf one of God Almighties Fools, he muſt have patience; and that if he would let him alone a little, he himſelf would ſoon be weary of the courſe he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.</hi> But he ſtill perſiſting to urge His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, to prevent the ruin of a Family, that had always been faithful to him; the King bid him go to the Atturny General, and Order him in His Name, to do what the Law ſhould direct, for the ſecurity of the Eſtate.</p>
                  <p>But to ſhow how far the Jeſuits were from ſuch a Deſign, as Dr. <hi>VVarner</hi> pretended. It will not be amiſs to reflect, how much Father <hi>Travers,</hi> as we have ſaid, diffwaded him from this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, at his firſt propoſal of it. And to inſert here, what Sir <hi>Iohn VVarner</hi> affirms; <hi>Viz.</hi> That having in his Noviſhip a Scruple, that he comply'd not with our Saviours Counſel, <hi>Of giving all to the Poor, and following him:</hi> Unleſs after the Proviſion for his Children, he gave the Reſidue of his Eſtate to Pious Uſes; eſpecially that part of it, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore belong'd to an Ancient Abby, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requir'd a Reſtitution to the Roman Catholic
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56701:43"/>Church, to which it formerly belong'd. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he conſulted his Superiour, and propoſing to him theſe doubts; he aſſur'd him, that no obligation of Conſcience lay upon him, to diſpoſe of it any other way, than he had already done, in giving it to his Brother; and that in the Circumſtances he was in, it was more prudence, for him to do ſo, than otherways; whereby he would but give occaſion to many Clamours and diſturbances, that would certainly follow, a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſettlement. And beſides added, that he might as freely Entail that part of the Eſtate, that formerly belong'd to an Abby, upon his Brother, as any other Land; it being his Anceſtors by purchace; and the Pope having alſo by his Diſpenſation (ſent into <hi>England</hi> by Cardinal <hi>Poole,</hi> in Time of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Raign) made the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of ſuch Revenues, lawful to all perſons, even Catholics themſelves; counſelling them only to a greater liberality in Alms-giving, to obtain Gods bleſſing, upon their Eſtates they enjoy'd by his Diſpenſation; and therefore he ought to have no farther Scruple in this Point. This Anſwer of his Superiour, freed him from all the before mention'd doubts: And ought to clear the Jeſuits, of that unjuſt Cenſure they ly under of Covetuouſneſs; when they refus'd ſuch an offer, as was here made them.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> finding his Unckle ſtill buſie in an earneſt purſuit after his Eſtate; thô he was aſſur'd by his Counſel, that the ſettlement he had made, could not be Annul'd by any thing, leſs than an
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56701:44"/>Act of Parliament; yet thought it better by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, to put a ſtop to his Unckles endeavours, than permit him, and his Brother to engage in a Law Sute; and thereby ſpend what he pretended to conſerve, which would be prejudical to both. But Sir <hi>Thomas Hanner</hi> being then in Town, he reſolv'd firſt to go to him; and beforehand ſent him a Note, to know whether a Viſit would not be ungratful. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> who believ'd him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond-ſea, ſeem'd overjoy'd at the ſight of his Letter, that brought him the good news of his being ſtill in <hi>England;</hi> and anſwer'd him, that he was ready to receive him with open Arms, and to Embrace him with the ſame tenderneſs as ever; as indeed he did: His Tears at their Meeting teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, how great and Paternal an Affection he ſtill had for him. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> after a hearty expreſſion of the continuance of his kindneſs, propos'd to him all the Arguments he could, to perſwade him to lay aſide his deſign, of parting with his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and betaking himſelf to a Religious State of Life. But perceiving Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> ſo fix'd in his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, as that he found no hopes of perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to change them; he told him, <hi>He would ſoon have greater cauſe than himſelf, to repent ſuch an enterprize; and when 'twould be too late, find the Inconveniences, unto which he expos'd both himſelf, and his VVife. However, he would give him no cauſe to ſuſpect he wanted that kindneſs for him, he had ever profeſs'd; and therefore, thô he could eaſily have croſt his deſign, he would not do it; but when the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor offer'd him a Decree to take Poſſeſsion of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56701:44"/>Eſtate, ſo long as he and his VVife should continue beyond-ſea; he abſolutly refus'd it, rather than he would by accepting it, given him any cauſe of diſquiet, or unkind thoughts of him.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> alſo, ſeeming much concern'd for having taken ſuch meaſures, as forc'd him out of Town the next Morning; told him, <hi>That he would not have left it ſo ſoon, had he known of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it.</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> beg'd leave to accompany him the firſt Days Journy; it being probably the laſt time, he ſhould have the opportunity of enjoying his Company; which was granted with a great deal of ſatisfaction on both ſides. The next Day Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was very preſſing to have Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> go with him home, and to ſtay ſo long there, as he deſign'd to remain in <hi>England.</hi> But he very gratfully refus'd the invitation, reſolving to follow his Lady, as ſoon as he had put a ſtop to his Unckles pretenſions, which requir'd his Preſence at <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame Night he return'd from accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> he went to the neareſt Tavern to his Unckles Houſe in <hi>Covent-Garden;</hi> and ſent a Meſſenger to let Dr. <hi>VVarner</hi> know, that a friend of his deſir'd to ſpeak with him there. When his Unckle came; he was ſo overjoy'd at the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſight of Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> or ſo confounded at what he had done, as he was not able to ſpeak: So that Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> out of compaſſion, was forc'd to make that Apology for him, which he ought to have made himſelf; thanking him for the pains and trouble he had taken for the ſecurity of the Eſtate (as he thought) thô there was no
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56701:45"/>need of it; becauſe he had ſettl'd it, as firmly as was poſſible by Law, upon his Brother; who (if he had conſulted him) would have ſhown him the Deeds; wherefore, now he was aſſur'd of this from his own Mouth, he hop't that he would deſiſt from giving himſelf or his Brother any farther trouble in this affair. He promis'd, he would, and was as good as his word; uſing no other endeavours afterwards, for getting the Eſtate into his Hands; which he ſaw was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the Poſſeſſion of Mr. <hi>Francis VVarner</hi> his Nephew, the next Heir to it.</p>
                  <p>But to return to my Lady (from whom I have made this neceſſary digreſſion to ſatisfie the Reader why Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> did not accompany her) ſhe took Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 29th. of <hi>October,</hi> and landed at <hi>Dunkirck,</hi> the 30th. where ſhe no ſooner arriv'd, but ſhe went immediatly to the <hi>English Poor Clares,</hi> and was extreamly pleas'd with their Poor and Rigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner of living: She took the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of paſſing from thence by Water to <hi>Bruges,</hi> where ſhe went to the <hi>English</hi> Monaſtry of the Order of St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> and there met with one, whom God Almighty had not long before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd, with an extraordinary Call to the Catholic Faith, as well as to a Religious courſe of Life; and who had given a very great example of courage and zeal in embracing both. This perſon was Mrs. <hi>Catherine Holland,</hi> Daughter to Sir <hi>Iohn Holland</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who by her own Reading, and her Mothers Pious example, who was a Catholic, (Almighty God's Grace alſo concurring)
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56701:45"/>was ſo mov'd, to embrace the Catholic Religion, and a Religious State; as that without her Fathers knowledge, ſhe went to <hi>Flanders,</hi> there to Conſecrate her ſelf wholy to Gods ſervice; even before ſhe was a Catholic, or admitted into the Roman Catholic Church. But as ſoon as ſhe came to <hi>Bruges,</hi> ſhe Reconcil'd her ſelf, and took the Habit amongſt the <hi>English</hi> Religious of the Order of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in that Town; Providence ſo ordering it, that the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> ſhould be there at the ſame time, who undertook, if her Father did not give her the ordinary Portion, requir'd by the Community at her Profeſſion; that he would pay it: But her Father thinking this might reflect upon him, gave the Portion himſelf, and freely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd the Dukes engagement. After Mutual Congratulations with each other, not only for being Members of the True Church of Chriſt, but alſo for being call'd to the higheſt State of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in it, the embracing his Counſels (which Mark of Sanctity ſeem'd wanting in the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church they had quitted) my Lady took leave to purſue her Journy towards <hi>Liege,</hi> and went the ſame Day to <hi>Gaunt;</hi> where ſhe was very kindly receiv'd by the <hi>English Benedictine</hi> Dames: And there as well as at other Monaſtrys ſhe paſs'd, was much Edified at their chearful Converſation, and Religious Modeſty; the very Air of their Countenances, evidencing that Interior Peace and comfort, which the World is not able to give; their Edifying Diſcourſes alſo rekindled afreſh her deſiers of a Religious State; ſo that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56701:46"/>ſhe haſten'd what ſhe could to <hi>Liege,</hi> being in pain till ſhe arriv'd at her Center; where ſhe hop't to meet thoſe healing Joys, which the diſtracted and thoughtful cares of a Secular Life could not afford. Thither ſhe came on the 6th. of <hi>September,</hi> promiſing her ſelf that happineſs, ſhe had ſo long in vain ſought after.</p>

                  <p>But that which would have charm'd others, even at her firſt coming and enterance into the Monaſtry, gave little ſatisfaction to her; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that the ſame Night ſhe arriv'd, in return to all thoſe Cordial expreſſions of kindneſs, the Reverend Mother, and Religious ſhew'd her, and her Children; ſhe declar'd, that ſhe thought that was not the place, Almighty God had call'd her out of the World, to live in.

                  <p>The time of her Schollarſhip, was partly taken up with the ſollicitude, and care ſhe had for Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was ſtill in <hi>England;</hi> partly with Pious thoughts how to ſet out and Adorn the Church.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56701:48"/>from Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> and that ſhe refus'd to make any other declaration of her ſelf or Quality; than that having told him of her coming over, and that probably ſhe ſhould paſs by <hi>Liege,</hi> he had deſir'd her in his Name to give a Viſit to his Daughter and Grand-children, whom ſhe would find in an <hi>English</hi> Monaſtry, in that Town) excus'd her Childrens coming to her; thô ſhe earneſtly preſt to ſee them: Fearing there might be a greater deſign in this Viſit, than only kindneſs as the Lady pretended: Which that ſhe might the more eaſily prevent; and at the ſame time avoid the diſturbance alſo, ſhe found in her Soul, by the diſtraction ſhe receiv'd from her Childrens preſence; ſhe reſolv'd pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly to remove them to the <hi>Vrſulin's:</hi> And the Queen Mother of <hi>England</hi> having upon her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers account, (who as before related, had been Maid of Honor to Her Majeſty,) expreſs'd a kindneſs to my Lady on all occaſions; ſhe took the liberty of beſeeching Her Majeſty, that ſhe would vouchſafe to take her Children under her Royal Protection; who where otherwiſe in great danger, either by ſuttlety or force, to be taken from her, and carried into <hi>England:</hi> And at the ſame time, ſhe humbly Petition'd Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, to ſignifie to the Superiour of the <hi>Vrſulin</hi>'s at <hi>Liege</hi> (where ſhe had privatly plac'd her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) her Gracious concern for them.

                  <p>Having upon this occaſion depriv'd her ſelf of that Natural ſatisfaction, the ſight of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren muſt neceſſarily give her; and at the ſame time freed her ſelf from that care and trouble, that accompany'd their preſence; ſhe reſolv'd ſeriouſly to apply her ſelf to Virtue, and to a Practice of the foundation of all Vertues, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.

                     <p>How she came to be call'd to a more Rigorous State of Life, or to a ſtricter Order.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT happen'd upon occaſions, that ſhe was now and then call'd to the Grate; many finding (eſpecially a Canon of St. <hi>Lambert</hi>) great advantages by the Viſits they made her; which were always ſpent in Pious Diſcourſes: That which others would have look't upon, as no great hindrance to Recollection; ſhe took ſo much to heart, that ſhe was reſolv'd to break of all Commerce with Creatures; that her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56701:50"/>might wholy be with her Creator; and thô ſhe obey'd chearfully the Reverend Mother in going to the Grate; yet ſhe fail'd not to complain to her Ghoſtly Father, that ſhe found by experience, that all Converſation which was not with God, left behind it a certain bitterneſs, and heavineſs of heart: That ſhe thought ſhe was call'd to a more ſtrict retreat and conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where nothing might draw upon her the praiſes, or admiration of others; in which ſolitude ſhe did not Queſtion, but to find a greater liberty, to give ſcope to her fervor; and thereby, to taſt more liberally the ſweetneſs of Divine Union; and to exerciſe with more freedom, the Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of an Auſtere Life; which her preſent State did neither require, or even permit. She was ſo Enamour'd with theſe ſentiments of Auſterity and Solitude; and ſo great was her fervor, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating her ſelf upon her Knees, ſhe beg'd of him in the preſence of the Bleſſed Sacrament, that he would give her leave at leaſt, to make a Vow never more to go to the Grate, whilſt ſhe ſtay'd there; and in the mean time earneſtly Pray'd him to offer up ſome Devotions to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God for her, to know what was his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will concerning her removal: She deſiring nothing but what ſhe thought was moſt pleaſing to him. He told her the inconveniencies, that would follow ſuch a Vow, and promis'd her that he would particularly beg of Almighty God, to give him light how to direct her; he bid her to have a great confidence in God, and reſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56701:51"/>aſſur'd that he would aſſiſt her, to compaſs what he inſpir'd her to do, if it were his Will, that ſhe ſhould remove; or, if it were not, would give her comfort, and ſatisfaction in the place, and Practice of the Rule, where ſhe was at preſent.</p>
                  <p>Some there were, who judging her Confeſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious might too far comply, with her inclination to Solitude and Mortification, and thereby alſo ſecond her intention of a change; did forbid him any more to Viſit her; hoping if it were ſo, that his abſence might moderate theſe deſires, which probably, he by too great a condeſcention, might have augmented. But ſhe extreamly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his abſence; and the more, becauſe ſhe found, he was blam'd, for Counſelling her to do, what he had diſſuaded her from; and therefore, ſuffer'd in the Opinions of others, upon her account: This went nearer to her, than what ſhe ſuffer'd her ſelf; and to take away this miſunderſtanding; ſhe importun'd the Reverend Mother, that the Father might once more come to her; whoſe Counſel was wholy neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe could make a final determination what to do: In the mean time, in the middle of theſe continual conflicts, and agitations of Mind, ſhe ſuffer'd a kind of Martyrdom. At his return, he ſo efficaciouſly anſwer'd all her Objections, for her removal, and ſo clearly convinc'd her, that it was Gods Will ſhe ſhould ſtay and ſettle there; that ſhe began to think of continuing, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Vows; but withal told him, that the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56701:51"/>chief Motive that made her fix upon this Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, was, that ſhe might be no hindrance to Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> (now Brother <hi>Clare</hi>) to make his; ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, that if the ſame deſires of removal, remain'd after her Profeſſion; the Church would give her liberty, of entring a ſtricter Order; which ſhe could as well do, two or three Years after, as then. Whereupon he reply'd, that thô the Church could indeed give ſuch a permiſſion; yet it would never grant it, upon account of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral great, and general inconveniencies, that would accompany ſuch a removal; which the good of a particular perſon, thô very great, could never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence. Wherefore, if ſhe ever reſolv'd to quit the Order ſhe was in, ſhe muſt do it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe made her Vows, or not at all: And therefore deſir'd her, ſeriouſly to recommend the matter to God in her Prayers, as he would alſo do in his.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt ſhe was thus making her fervent Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, before the Holy Sacrament of the Altar, to beg light from Heaven, how ſhe might ſerve her Spouſe upon Earth; on a ſuddain, ſhe ſaw a Stream of freſh Glaring light, come from the Bleſſed Sacrament towards her; from which ſhe felt ſuch an Interior joy in her Soul; that the Miſtreſs of the Novices, then kneeling by, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a change in her countenance; and asked what might be the cauſe of ſo ſenſible an alteration, as ſhe perceiv'd in her? She would gladly have conceal'd this, if Obedience would have ſuffer'd her; but that prevailing, ſhe told the reaſon of it.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56701:52"/>Whether this favor was to confirm her in the Myſtery of the Real Preſence (the doubt of which gave the firſt occaſion of her Converſion) or to ſtrengthen her in the deſire of ſolitude and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; none but God, who beſtow'd it, knows; but after this ſhe ſtill perſiſted with more earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than before, to gain her Ghoſtly Father's conſent, for her removal to a ſtricter Order; where ſhe might be unknown: She was more and more perſwaded that her deſign was no illuſion; ſeeing ſhe found, that the manner of her Converſion, and her reſolution of embracing a Religious State, having taking Air abroad; both Religious, as well as Seculars ſhew'd upon that account, a great eſteem and admiration of her: Which ſhe thought no ſmall hinderance to her Perfection. And having heard, that the <hi>Carthuſianeſſes</hi> (beſides the conſtant rigour they live in) are never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after their entrance, either to receive a Viſit, or Letter from any friend; ſhe earneſtly beg'd of her Confeſſarius to uſe his endeavours, for her Admiſſion amongſt them, without diſcovering her Quality or Condition; that then ſhe might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that happineſs, which ſhe only deſir'd in this World, <hi>Viz.</hi> A conſtant Communication with God, without the interruption, or converſation of friends. This retreat was ſtill the joyful Object of her Mind, where abſconding, ſhe might attend to the exerciſes of an Interior Life, and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Perfection: And underſtanding, that thoſe that were not Virgins, could not enjoy amongſt them, the Priviledge of being Superior, or of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56701:52"/>bearing any other Office; ſhe hop't by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Member of ſuch a Community; to ſee her ſelf the leaſt, and laſt of a Religious Houſe: In expectation of which happineſs, ſhe extreamly comforted her ſelf. Theſe kind of thoughts had ſo poſſeſſed her Soul, that ſhe could never enjoy her ſelf whilſt ſhe ſtay'd at <hi>Liege;</hi> and hence it was, that the reſpect and civility ſhewed her by the Religious, was ſo great a Mortification to her.</p>
                  <p>Her Ghoſtly Father Communicating her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to the Prior of the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> at <hi>Liege,</hi> then going to a General Chapter of the Order, had gain'd a promiſe of his beſt aſſiſtance, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining her wiſhes; and in the mean time, ſhe Wrote to Brother <hi>Clare,</hi> to deſire him to give her leave to enter amongſt the <hi>Carthuſianeſſes:</hi> And that ſhe might not put any obſtacle to his deſigns, nor hinder his proceeding in them; ſhe inclos'd this following Act of Renunciation, which ſhe thought would have been ſufficient to Legalize his Profeſſion; without her making of hers.

                     <p>How she reſolves to enter amongst the <hi>Poor Clares.</hi> Her departure and journy from <hi>Liege,</hi> and her arrival at <hi>Graveling.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BRother <hi>Clare</hi> finding her fixt upon a removal, and having acquaintance at the <hi>Poor Clares</hi> at <hi>Graveling;</hi> which was the firſt Order, that ſhe had ſeen in theſe Countries, and then ſeem'd to like it very much; hop't the propoſal of her going thither, might take effect; if ſhe would not ſtay where ſhe was: He being deſirous, that ſhe ſhould rather be amongſt thoſe of her own Nation, than Strangers; ſince frequent examples have ſhew'd, how eaſily the Enemy raiſes jealouſies, and diſguſts, in thoſe that enter among Externs. For this reaſon he procur'd a Book of the Rules of St. <hi>Clare,</hi> which he gave her to Read; and deſir'd her, for his comfort and ſatisfaction (if ſhe lik'd the Rules which ſhe would find rigorous enough) rather to make choiſe of that place to go to, than any other. She promis'd to Read them, and was ſo taken with them, that ſhe reſolv'd, if her Ghoſtly Father approv'd of it, immediatly to betake her ſelf to that courſe of Life: Which was a great ſubject of joy to Brother <hi>Clare;</hi> thô on the other ſide, it was a great
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56701:55"/>trouble to him, to find that his Siſter and Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman; who had enter'd with her, reſolv'd to take the ſame courſe: For he fear'd, that it might be a prejudice to the Monaſtry they left; which had been extraordinary kind to them. Since the World, which is too apt to cenſure, might think, that three Religious going away together, could not but have ſome Motive of diſguſt, or diſlike to the place; and did not purely leave it, out of a deſire to ſerve God, in a ſtricter and more auſtere Order.</p>
                  <p>He therefore, oppos'd his Siſters and Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womans going, and had juſt reaſon to diſſwade his Siſter; becauſe her Conſtitution was ſo weak, and her health ſo impair'd; that the Doctors would not permit her, even to comply with the Church-precept, in keeping her faſt in Lent: Whereas, in the place ſhe deſign'd to go to, ſhe muſt keep the Lenten Faſt as long as ſhe liv'd. He told her therefore, <hi>That this deſire of hers could not be good; it being too preſumptuous, and inconſiderate; to expect, that God should work a Miracle, for the ſatisfying of her own humor: Eſpecially, when in doing ſo, she went againſt the Advice of thoſe, whom he had ſubſtituted in his place, to direct her: That it was an ordinary Artifice of the Malignant Spirit, under pretence of a ſpecious and plauſible good, to draw ſeveral out of the way, God had plac'd them in:</hi> This Diſcourſe ſo ſenſibly afflicted her, that ſhe fell a weeping; ſaying, <hi>That she was ſure, that God had call'd her to a ſtricter Order, and that his Power and Grace, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways proportionable to his Call,</hi> The Reverend
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56701:55"/>Mother and the Religious, finding them ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to go, upon ſo good and ſolid Motives; were ſo kind, as to ſecond their Requeſts; and prevail'd with Brother <hi>Clare</hi> for their removal. This then being the good effect of Brother <hi>Clare</hi>'s Journy to <hi>Liege;</hi> he reſolv'd to haſten back to <hi>VVatten;</hi> to diſpatch all things neceſſary for their Admittance at <hi>Graveling,</hi> that they might the ſooner be able to follow him.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt other Diſcourſes, which Brother <hi>Clare</hi> had with Siſter <hi>Tereſa Clare,</hi> ſhe thanked him extreamly for the favor of a Letter, which he had procur'd her, from Father <hi>Philip Marini;</hi> a Miſſioner that came from <hi>China</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> to gain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to Labor with him in that large Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard: With whom Brother <hi>Clare</hi> coming acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (whilſt after her departure he ſtay'd at <hi>London</hi>) obtain'd from him a Letter of encouragment to her; which being from ſo Apoſtolical a Man (who had ſpent many Years in the hard and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Miſſion of <hi>China,</hi> not only expoſing his Life, during thoſe great Perſecutions, that happen'd, whilſt he was there; but alſo, in taking ſo long and dangerous a Journy for the procuring help for thoſe many Souls, that he had hopes to reduce by their aſſiſtance, to the true Faith) and as ſhe alſo profeſt, having given her ſo inexplicable a comfort in her undertaking, I thought worth your puruſal, as it is Tranſlated out of <hi>Italian,</hi> in which Language it was Writ.</p>

Writing to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of your Merit, I ought to do it in ſuch a manner, as may give you an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the reward of that Eternal happineſs, which you will certainly gain; not by running, but flying from the Liberty of the World, to the narrow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of a Cloyſter: Thrice happy are you, that have ſo great an aſſurance of Heaven, by ſo Noble and Generous a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of all pleaſures upon Earth; the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to embrace, what the World flies from, the Croſs of Chriſt: Following hereby, St. <hi>Tereſa</hi>'s admirable Leſſon, <hi>Either to ſuffer, or die for Ieſus.</hi> This is that Jewel, which the wiſe Marchant gave all he had to purchaſe; and did not repent his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: And thó he became Poor in the Eyes of the World; yet he recover'd his loſs, by purchaſing a Good, which was of greater value, than all other Goods: How happy then, is the Renunciation of that Bleſſed Soul, which leaving all looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing; ſtill finding all, in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of <hi>Ieſus?</hi> The Apoſtles Patrimony, after they had forſaken their Parents,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56701:56"/>Friends, and all they had, was a pure nothing; which put into the Hands of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith excellently well, ſo multiply'd, as to become all things; <hi>Totum reliquit qui ſibi nil retinuit; He left all, who retain'd nothing to himſelf.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold therefore, the nothing, which the Apoſtles reſerv'd, but this nothing put into the Hands of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> grew to the hight of that Glory, to which they were call'd. At this Day (ſo many Ages after their departure out of the World) we proclaim their Dignity, and give them greater Titles; than ever the Ambition of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch could Uſurpe. I would ſay more of this ſubject, but time will not give me leave; therefore, to ſend you my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion about leaving the World, my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is; that it is not ſufficient to go out of it, to live in Religion; unleſs we bid adieu to, and renounce all things, that are united to it. The difference between thoſe who leave, and renounce is this: He that leaves, can return to the thing he left, but he that renounceth, looſeth the Dominion, over what he renounces; in the ſame manner, as a Man does his Right, to what he has Sold. This was that which our Saviour ſaid to the Young
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56701:57"/>Man; <hi>Vade, vende omnia quae habes, veni, &amp; ſequere me; go, Sell all you have, come, and follow me;</hi> which words agree with thoſe others; <hi>Niſi quis renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit omnibus, quae poſſidet, non poteſt m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

'Tis to have Chriſt for our Maſter, Father, Spouſe, Lord, God, and All. But what need I Write after this manner to you? Who I know practice better things than I can ſuggeſt. Wherefore, I Write not, to give you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, but to praiſe your Generoſity; by which you have not only left the World, with your Body; but with your Soul alſo, have renounc'd all it's Vanities; and every thing that relates to it. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven preſerve you by it's Holy Grace, in your good Reſolutions till Death: Pray for me your Pooreſt Servant, in our Lord.</p>

                  <p>She own'd, that this Letter, and the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation which ſhe ſometimes had, with two great Servants of God (one an <hi>Auguſtin</hi> Fryer, who had receiv'd ſuch extraordinary and Celeſtial favors, that he was even forbidden to Celebrate in public; having ſeveral times been Elevated in time of Maſs, to the aſtoniſhment of the beholders. The other was a Secular Gentleman, call'd Mr. <hi>Ruiſſon,</hi> whom we ſhall afterwards have an occaſion to ſpeak of) had been of very great advantage to her, in her Spiritual progreſs in Virtue: And as the Contents of this Letter were truly Pious; ſo were their Diſcourſes, of nothing but of God. They ſpeaking of Heavenly things, ſo feelingly, that ſhe was wholy tranſported with their Converſation, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd by their Diſcourſe, to ſeek Retirement and Mortification, as the beſt means to find God: Eſpecially by the <hi>Auguſtin:</hi> Who for many Years, with the leave of his Superior, had liv'd only upon Bread and Water; together with ſuch Raw Roots, and Herbs, as came out o their Garden.</p>
                  <p>Upon Brother <hi>Clare</hi>'s going away, Siſter <hi>Tereſa Clare,</hi> deſir'd him to ſend ſome particular conveniency for their Journy, together with a Prieſt, that might accompany them; thereby to avoid the trouble of all ſorts of People, which is unavoidable in the common way of Traveling. Wherefore, as ſoon as he return'd to <hi>VVatten,</hi> he obtain'd of Father <hi>Richard Barton,</hi> then Rector of St. <hi>Omers,</hi> leave for Mr. <hi>Edward Hall</hi> (then a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56701:58"/>Secular Prieſt, now of the <hi>Society of Ieſus</hi>) to conduct her, his Siſter, and Kinſwoman, from <hi>Liege:</hi> Where, as ſoon as Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> arriv'd, ſhe haſten'd to begin her Journy, and obtain'd leave of the Reverend Mother, and Community, that ſhe, and her two Companions, might keep their Religious Habits; till they ſhould change them for that of another Order: Aſſuring them, that it was not for want of any Edification, or good Example in their Houſe, that they remov'd to another; but to comply with thoſe impulſes, which they had receiv'd from God; to ſerve him in a ſtricter way of living; for which thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Rudiments of Religious obſervance, which they had receiv'd there, had diſpos'd them.

                     <q>THe ſharpneſs of her Wit, and the Solidity of her Judgment, ſerv'd her as moſt fit Inſtruments, to Contemn the World and Contemplate God. Her Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taught her to diſcry how vain a thing it is, and how much beneath thoſe that are call'd to Gods ſervice, to attend or care for any thing; but the promotion of his Honor. From hence Sprung in Siſter <hi>Tereſa Clare,</hi> an immenſe deſire, to be as intirely ſeparated from the World in Body; as ſhe was reſolv'd to leave it in Mind. Her Will ſerv'd her only to promote Piety; ſhe was never weary of Spiritual Diſcourſes; and fed her Soul with extraordinary contentment, whenever matters of Devotion were hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: But out of pretence of being young in Faith, ſhe very humbly and earneſtly deſir'd to be Inſtructed; and her Queries were commonly about the higheſt Points of Faith; althô even her Speculative Queſtions, tended ſtill more to move af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, than ſatisfie curioſity: And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe were matter of her Prayer, yet they ſerv'd as bare propoſals: For the Will had always the greateſt ſhare in them. By little, and little, ſhe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56701:59"/>grew ſo inflam'd with the Love of God, that ſhe car'd to hear of nothing, but what increas'd this fire. My chiefeſt labor was to moderate her fervor, and aſſwage her heat, in all which I found her moſt Humble and Obedient; ſhe profeſſing to me, that when ſhe knew God's Will, ſhe would ſpare no labor to put it in Execution. It is hardly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, how exceſſively great her deſire to ſuffer for God was, and with what Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſhe encounter'd, even the greateſt difficulties. I was half terrified, to ſee her ſtrugle with Nature, for the Maſtry; and comforted, to ſee how reſolv'd ſhe was, not to yield an Inch; yet ſhe did chearfully let go her hold, when it was judg'd fit for her to relax. I confeſs, that my inſight in ſublime matters is very dimm, and was very unfit to manage her Soul, that was continually Mounting on High. I bleſs the Divine Goodneſs, that did me the favor, to let me treat with a Perſon, ſo truly Spiritual.</q> Thus he. And her Miſtreſs of Novices, added theſe particulars to the ſame perſon, concerning her, <hi>That Siſter</hi> Clare <hi>having liv'd in that Community above a Year and an half, she was never known by any one to fail in any Religious Duty, never heard to ſpeak an unneceſſary word, or found guilty of the leaſt imperfection.</hi>

                  <p>It would be too tedious to ſet down a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Diary of their Journy. I ſhall therefore, only in ſhort give you ſuch an account, as Father <hi>Hall,</hi> a Perſon of known Virtue and Prudence, gave of it; in his own words. <q>Siſter <hi>Tereſa</hi> all along her Journy, and the reſt with her, thô it was extreamly hot, and their Religious Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits incommoded them very much; yet never fail'd to perform their Duties, as if they had been in a Monaſtry. She and her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions for the moſt part Sung their Office all along the way; ſhe rigorouſly abſtain'd from eating Fleſh, and was reſolv'd, as far as I would permit her, to live up to the Rule of the <hi>Poor Clares.</hi> When ſhe was worſt treated, ſhe was moſt content, and the difficulties of her Journy ſeem'd a pleaſure to her; becauſe they gave her an occaſion of Mortification. Coming to <hi>Sicham,</hi> a place of great Devotion to our Lady, of which the Fathers of the <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> have care; where ſeveral conſiderable Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles had been wrought by her Interceſſion; ſhe, notwithſtanding ſo tedious a Journy, would go to the Church, even before ſhe took any refreſhment. Where to my wonder and ſhame (not being able to follow her Example) ſhe kneel'd two full hours, without any motion of her Body: She Communicated at the ſame place the next Day, and ſpent moſt part of the Morning upon her Knees: Every Day ſhe came to Confeſſion; and every other Day ſhe Communicated. An Oratorian Father, who
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56701:60"/>caſually joyn'd himſelf to us in our Journy, was ſo Edified with her Carriage and Diſcourſe, that at parting, he declar'd to me; <hi>That he was not only aſſur'd, she was a Perſon of Quality, but a Saint alſo.</hi> Nor was her Diſcourſe only Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, whilſt the Oratorian was with us; but it laſted all along our Journy: Except only; when ſhe Sung the Divine Office, or Read a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Book; for ſhe had an excellent <hi>French</hi> Book with her, which ſhe turn'd into ſo good <hi>English,</hi> for the benefit of her Companions; that I verily thought, it had been in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, ſhe Reading it ſo currently, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſtop, or he ſitation; till ſuch time as accidentally taking it up to Read, to my aſtoniſhment I found it <hi>French.</hi> Her deſire of Mortification and Auſterity in her Journy was extraordinary; and if I had permitted her to act according to her Inclination, ſhe would certainly have prejudic'd her health. At length he concludes: Whatever I obſerv'd in any Saints Life, that was great, and good; I think truly I faw it Coppy'd out exactly in Siſter <hi>Clare.</hi> Her patience and reſignation to Gods Will, in all the diſſaſters of the Journy (which were not a few) her Humility and Charity to her Companions, and her Obedience to me, were admirable; and manifeſted the true Spirit of God in her Soul. It was my good Fortune, thô unworthy of it, to be her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtor this little time; and I am oblig'd to thank God as long as I live, for conferring
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56701:60"/>ſuch a favor upon me. Indeed, whilſt I was in her Company, I thought my ſelf in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Houſe: She never omitting any of her Conventual Obſervances, as before ſaid, but conſtantly keeping the ſame diſtribution of time for all her Actions, as if ſhe had been in the ſtricteſt Incloſure.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being arriv'd at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> Father <hi>Michael Kinſman</hi> came thither from <hi>VVatten,</hi> to meet and conduct her, from thence to <hi>Graveling;</hi> where he was then Director, or extraordinary Confeſſor. Here ſhe, together with her Siſter and Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, receiv'd the Biſhop's Benediction, and his permiſſion alſo to Enter at <hi>Graveling.</hi> As they paſs'd thither, they Din'd at <hi>VVatten,</hi> where Brother <hi>Clare</hi> was then a Novice; who on purpoſe abſented himſelf, having beforehand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with her to do ſo. From thence ſhe arriv'd at <hi>Graveling,</hi> betwixt Eight and Nine a Clock at Night, the Third of <hi>Auguſt:</hi> 'Twas deſign'd that ſhe ſhould be Cloath'd, at her firſt arrival at the Monaſtry; but coming ſo late, the Ceremony was defer'd till next Morning. Perhaps Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſo order'd it, to give her an occaſion of entring upon that courſe of Life, with a greater Act of Mortification, the better to prepare her ſelf for it, than otherwiſe ſhe would have had; which a Servant of the Monaſtry diſcover'd. One may eaſily imagine how weary ſhe was, after the fatigues of ſo long and tireſome a Journy; and without doubt her tender and delicate Body muſt neceſſarily have been much weaken'd, and her
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56701:61"/>ſtrength almoſt exhauſted, by the heat of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the heavineſs of her Habit, and the practice of ſuch Auſterity, as ſhe had obtain'd leave for upon the way; yet ſhe would not accept of thoſe Poor preparations, and conveniencies, which were provided by the <hi>Poor Clares,</hi> for her repoſe: For as ſoon as ſhe thought all were retir'd, ſhe forſook her Bed, and lay all Night upon the bare Boards, denying that eaſe and ſolace to her wearied Limbs, which they ſeem'd indiſpenſably to require; and which ſuch a Lodging as ſhe left might have afforded. But not content with this, the Servant heard her take a long and ſharp Diſcipline, ſuteable to her fervor, and (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) to diſpoſe her ſelf the better, for ſuch a Life of Mortification, as the next Day ſhe was to undertake.</p>
                  <p>The next Morning, ſhe and her two Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were privatly Cloath'd, changing only one Religious Habit for another: For ſhe would by no means admit of any public Ceremony this time; becauſe the confuſion, which ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd at her Cloathing at <hi>Liege,</hi> was yet too freſh in her Memory. Providence at their Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gave them ſuch Names, as ſhew'd their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted deſires, and endeavours to attain to the hight of Perfection. My Lady <hi>VVarner</hi> had given her the Name of <hi>Clare of Ieſus,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth VVarner</hi> her Siſter-in-law <hi>Mary Clare,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Frances Skelion</hi> her Kinſwoman, that of <hi>Frances Ioſeph.</hi>

                  <p>SIſter <hi>Clare of Ieſus</hi> enters upon her Second Noviſhip, with no leſs fervor, than chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and with far more contentment than ſhe had done the firſt. The Auſterity and fervor of the Religious, together with their conſtant ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity, animated her with a new Spirit of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and their frequent Spiritual Diſcourſes, gave her Soul it's deſir'd food. That neatneſs joyn'd with extream Poverty, which they practis'd, was an extraordinary comfort to her; and gave her great encouragment in her new, thô hard enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. She now reſolv'd to lay a ſolid founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Virtue, and to acquire a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of her ſelf, by a ſelf-denyal. The Induſtry which ſhe ſhew'd, in ſeeking low and abject Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, ſufficiently declar'd her great Humility: And leſt that reſpect and kindneſs, which the good Religious at <hi>Liege</hi> paid her, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd here; ſhe beg'd to be looked upon, and imploy'd, as the laſt in the Houſe. And thô ſoon
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56701:62"/>after her Cloathing, the Plague broak out in <hi>Graveling,</hi> yet it was no manner of diſcouragment to her; for ſhe ſtill maintain'd the ſame evenneſs of temper, and all her actions were done with the ſame vigor and diligence as before: And leſt Brother <hi>Clare</hi> ſhould be concern'd for that, which did not in the leaſt trouble her, ſhe deſir'd leave to Write to him; which ſhe did as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>

                  <p>One clauſe of the foreſaid Letter (wherein Siſter <hi>Clare</hi> ſaith, <hi>That she had no cauſe to fear any thing, againſt which ſo many Servants of God Pray'd ſo much</hi>) gives me an occaſion to make a ſhort digreſſion; which I the more willingly take, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am ſure it will be to the Readers ſatisfaction: Thô I fear 'twill be diſpleaſing to the perſons it relates to, to whom I know nothing is ſo Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying as a Relation of what redounds to their praiſe; yet I hope they will pardon me, ſince the paſſage it ſelf, tends ſo much to God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Glory. Whilſt the Plague rag'd at <hi>Graveling,</hi> one of the Religious fell Sick, with all the Symptoms of that dangerous diſtemper. A Siſter whoſe Office it was, to attend the Sick, came to Mother Abbeſs, and deſir'd, that ſhe might be remov'd out of the Common Infirmary;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56701:63"/>for fear of infecting others. Mother Abbeſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, <hi>That there was no need to remove her, and that she might ſtay where she was, without any damage to the reſt.</hi> But the Zeal which this good Siſter had in her Office, mov'd her to urge it the ſecond time, which Mother Abbeſs refus'd as before; yet ſo great were the Siſters importunities, as at laſt to extort this extraordinary Reply from the Abbeſs; <hi>Good Siſter be not afraid, for if our Bleſſed Lady be in Heaven, none of my Religious shall take any harm from this infection.</hi> She as well as all that heard it, receiv'd this Anſwer with aſtoniſhment; and thô they found it afterwards true, yet they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tell from whence their Abbeſs receiv'd ſuch an aſſurance, as ſhe here expreſt, till after her Death; when her Confeſſor told them, that when the Plague began, our Bleſſed Lady appear'd to her, with all her Religious under her Mantle; aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her, that ſhe would protect and preſerve them from the Plague. The Reader would not wonder at the Relation of this Paſſage, had he been acquainted with the extraordinary Sanctity of Mother <hi>Taylor,</hi> the foreſaid Abbeſs; but what I ſhall have hereafter an occaſion to relate of her, will give him ſuch a knowledge of her Piety, and confidence in God, that he will not think it ſtrange he ſhould reward it with ſo ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar a favor.</p>
                  <p>But to return to take a view of the Example of the Novices Humility. She was never heard to ſay any thing in her own defence, whereby ſhe might extenuate, or excuſe any imperfection;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56701:63"/>but was ſtill ready to own, and take any fault upon her, even where there was none. Her Modeſty would never ſuffer her to admit of any commendation from others; nor her Humility from her ſelf: Thô ſhe was often put upon ſuch Diſcourſes, as would inevitably have forced ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to it. When by Holy Obedience ſhe was deſir'd to ſpeak of her Converſion, ſhe was ſo far from Attributing any thing of it to her ſelf, that ſhe would wave all her own endeavours and attempts; and ſtrive to perſwade them, that it totally proceeded from the good Counſel and Example of others: Nor would ſhe ever ſpeak of her Family, of any paſſage in the World, of Brother <hi>Clare,</hi> or her Children, even when a fit occaſion was offer'd, unleſs ſhe was Commanded; and then with ſo much neglect and contempt of her ſelf, as created an eſteem, and wonder in thoſe that heard her. Her carriage was moſt ſubmiſſive and reſpectful to her Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, very affable and civil to her equals, and ſo obliging to inferiors, as if they had been above her; and that ſhe had ow'd a deference and obligation to them. Many were her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions to procure her own confuſion. Her ingenious Humility would make her find a fault in her ſelf, when there was none, and be glad of any occaſion, that might give her a ſubject of Mortification.</p>
                  <p>When ſuch kind of inventions fail'd her, ſhe caſt about to be put upon ſome humble and abject Office, and would ſtrive to have it no leſs
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56701:64"/>laborious, than humble; yet ſhew'd no leſs promptitude of Obedience in leaving the ſame employment, when ſhe was found in it, and deſir'd to do ſo. She was a great lover of thoſe things, which carry repugnance to ſenſe, never ſhewing the leaſt appearance of averſion; but was as compos'd and recollected in doing them, as if ſhe had been at her Prayer, or any other Spiritual Duty. On all other occaſions ſhe carried the ſame Spirit of Humility, and Gravity along with her, beging that ſhe might by no means be exempted, from any thing that was to be done in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. She was very often us'd to ſay with great affection, <hi>That nothing however inconſiderable it was, ought to be counted little, which is capable of pleaſing or diſpleaſing God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe Humiliations were perform'd, with an entire ſubmiſſion to her Superiors Orders: She always lookt upon Obedience as a faithful Guide, that could never miſlead; or as an Oracle, which never deceiv'd; and as the diſtinctive Mark, and Character of ſolid Devotion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe never conſulted her own thoughts, or followed the heat of her own fervor, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting thoſe, whom ſhe reverenc'd as the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, or Vice-gerents of God. Thô theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of her Humility were ſignal; yet, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, they were tranſcended by the following inſtances of her Obedience.</p>
                  <p>Her chief endeavours were not only to execute what was Commanded, but wholy to conform her Will, to the Will of her Superior. This
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56701:64"/>was the Teſt by which ſhe try'd all her actions: The Voice or leaſt Sign of a Superior was ſufficient to make her break of the Letter juſt begun, to quit any employment, as if ſhe never had enter'd upon it. The leaſt Rule or Ceremony, ſeem'd great in her Eyes, not conſidering ſo much what was Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as by whom. This readineſs in obeying was attended with a wonderful ſimplicity, the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable; becauſe as God had given her a ripe and ſolid Judgment, ſo ſhe by a conſtant Sacrifice, had ſo Captivated her own ſenſe and opinion, that ſhe arriv'd at the higheſt degree of Obedience, call'd that of the Underſtanding. There are ſo many ſingular paſſages of this kind in her Life, and ſo many undeniable proofs of this Virtue, that it would be no little injury done to this Holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not to ſet down ſome of them.</p>
                  <p>It is a cuſtom amongſt the Religious, who are profeſs'd, to have their black Vails new Dyed, once a Year; and all being order'd to give out their Vails for that purpoſe, ſhe with a Religious ſimplicity puts hers, thô White (as all thoſe of the Novices are) amongſt the reſt; ſuch was her blind Obedience, and ſo exact was her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to interpret and execute her Superiors Commands, according to the Letter. Another time Mother Abbeſs and ſhe being in private to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the former was on a ſuddain call'd away, upon ſome urgent buſineſs to the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe; who deſigning to return preſently, bid her ſtay there till ſhe came back: But the buſineſs ſhe went about, ſo took up her thoughts, that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56701:65"/>ſhe forgot her Command to the Novice, and return'd no more: This Obedient Soul ſtay'd here four Hours; and thô in the mean time the Bells Rung to ſeveral Conventual Obſervances; yet ſhe remain'd fixt to the place, where Obedience left her; and had continued longer, if the Miſtreſs of the Novices, at laſt miſſing her, had not call'd her away. What follows is yet more ſurprizing. Theſe Nuns lye conſtantly in their Habits, and are therefore in the beginning not accuſtom'd to the way of covering themſelves, when they go to Bed; the Miſtreſs therefore, out of a deſire to give her a particular aſſiſtance, knowing how much her tender Complexion requir'd it, bid her not cover her ſelf, till ſhe came to do it; which ſhe forgetting, they that call'd her in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, wondering to ſee her lye without a Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let in that cold Seaſon, told her Miſtreſs of it; which put her in mind of her own forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and gave her a knowledge of the Novices blind Obedience.</p>
                  <p>There alſo happen'd another time, that a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was Preached at a Cloathing upon this Text; <hi>Nigraſumſed formoſa; I am black but comely;</hi> from which the Preacher took occaſion to exhort the Spouſe, that was to take the Habit, to Humility; expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing how they were to make themſelves black to the Eyes of the World, to become more fair in the ſight of God: The Religious ſometime after ſpeaking of this paſſage, Mother Abbeſs jeſtingly ſaid to Siſter <hi>Clare, You alſo Siſter</hi> Clare <hi>muſt black your ſelf;</hi> ſhe preſently after, took occaſion to go
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56701:65"/>out into the Kitching, where ſhe black'd her Face and Hands all over, with the Soot of the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and return'd again to the place of Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with that Modeſty and chearful Gravity, as if nothing had happen'd. This ſight, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of exciting Laughter in thoſe that were preſent, mov'd them to Tears, to ſee what an humble Sacrifice, ſhe had made of her ſelf to blind Obedience.</p>

                     <p>Her Interior and Exterior Mortification, her ſingular Devotion to the Bleſſed Sacrament, her Modesty and Recollection.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>'TIs no wonder, ſhe arriv'd to ſuch a pitch of this ſimplicity, ſince even at her firſt coming to Religion, among other practices of Virtue, which ſhe enjoyn'd her ſelf; this was one, ſhe noted in her Book of good purpoſes: <hi>By the aſsiſtance of God's Grace, I will endeavour at leaſt Ten times a Day to contradict my own VVill and Iudgment, and willingly take all occaſions which the Divine Providence shall give me of doing it.</hi> So that without doubt, ſhe took all thoſe accidental oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions given her of contradicting her own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as ſent her by the Hand of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:56701:66"/>
                  <p>Nor were her Mortifications leſs than her O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; there was care taken leaſt ſhe ſhould exceed in the Macerations of her tender and delicate Body, which ſhe would have treated with the greateſt rigor, if leave had been gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her. To ſee her at Meals, was enough to have mov'd one to Devotion; her Modeſty, and Compoſure of Body; her Attention to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; her Moderation in Eating and Drinking, drew all Eyes upon her; thô ſhe ſeem'd to have none of her own; attending wholy to the Interior Preſence of God; thereby making the moſt ordinary Actions Meritorious. But this conſtant Self-denyal, and ſearch of her greateſt Mortification in all things; had by degrees ſo dryed up her radical moiſture, that ſhe ſuffer'd a continual Thirſt; which out of Love to Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication ſhe would not endeavour to quench even at Meals, and would never Drink between them, thô with leave, the Rule, permits it. But we need not wonder from whence ſuch an exact compliance with all theſe foreſaid Virtues pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; ſince they had ſuch an Origin, as ſhe her ſelf own'd to a Siſter; who asking her, <hi>How she could be ſo exact in all things?</hi> She reply'd, <hi>How can we be otherwiſe, when in all things we behold God?</hi> This celeſtial Anſwer mov'd her to ask another Queſtion; <hi>Viz. VVhat she would do if she were told, that she should Die within half an hour?</hi> She Anſwer'd, <hi>That she would neither change the place, nor the action, that Holy Obedience had ſet her about; becauſe she knew that in doing it, she performed
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56701:66"/>God's VVill.</hi> The other to try the eſteem which ſhe had of the preſent Action, carry'd the Queſtion a little farther, and asked her, <hi>VVhether she would not procure in ſuch a caſe; the Sacraments of the Church?</hi> She ſmilingly Anſwer'd, <hi>That none had a greater Eſteem and Veneration for the Sacraments than she had; yet she prefer'd the doing of God's VVill before any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, she could receive by them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If her Recollection were ſo great in indifferent Actions, we may gather that 'twas not leſs in thoſe Religious Duties which immediatly tend to God's ſervice. Her Devotion to the Divine Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, appear'd ſufficiently by the care ſhe had of a punctual performance of it, in her Journy from <hi>Liege</hi> before mention'd. She never miſt the exact time of coming to the Quire; and thô ſhe had leave of Mother Abbeſs to ſit up an hour after Quire, to ſpend that time in Mental Prayer; yet ſhe left the Quire at the ſame time with the reſt of the Religious; chooſing rather to perform that Devotion in her Cell, and deprive her ſelf of the advantage of doing it before the Bleſſed Sacrament; than appear ſingular thô in ſo good an action. The Religious who lay next her, ſuſpecting that ſhe retir'd to her Cell, rather to Pray than Repoſe, would now and then on ſet purpoſe, miſtake her Door for their own; and ſtill found her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate on the ground, exerciſing her ſelf in Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as well as Prayer; and Reverend Mother Abbeſs Teſtifies, that ſhe never enter'd her Cell upon any occaſion, but ſhe found her i
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56701:67"/>this humble poſture, which ſhe alſo conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practic'd in the Quire; till ſuch time as ſhe was forbid to do ſo, leſt it might impair her Health.</p>
                  <p>But there was nothing, to which her fervor carry'd her more, than to make frequent Viſits of the Bleſſed Sacrament. Her Devotion to it, being without doubt augmented by that favor, which Almighty God beſtow'd upon her at <hi>Liege.</hi> This made the Religious look upon her as a true Child and Heireſs, of her Holy Mother St. <hi>Clare.</hi> She was ſo Devout to this Myſtery, that fixt in a deep Contemplation, ſhe would kneel ſeveral hours together before it; without the leaſt outward motion of her Body: Where ſhe was very often bath'd in Tears, that proceeded from thoſe joyful Affections, which repleniſht her inflam'd heart. What theſe were, we may gather from ſome of them, which I ſhall here ſet down, as I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted them out of her Book: In which ſhe us'd to Treaſure up thoſe graces and favors, that Almighty God at ſuch times repleniſht her with; leſt for want of Regiſtring them, ſhe might become forgetful of his benefits. Knowing very well that the beſt means to obtain new Graces from Almighty God, is a grateful memory of thoſe benefits he has already beſtow'd: Gratitude no leſs obliging his Infinite Goodneſs, to a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral diſtribution of his Heavenly Treaſures; than ingratitude forcing him to ſtop the current of his boundleſs liberality.</p>

                     <p>Theſe, and many other ſuch like, were her dayly entertainments before the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe were the effects of that pure refin'd Love of God, which was rooted in her Soul. No Melancholly Humor, extravagant Devotions, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Scrupulous Reflections on her Life paſt, enter'd her Thoughts; or hinder'd her conſtancy in Gods Service. The Conſiderations of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, made them Soar far above the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary pitch of Creatures; and to take no reſt in any thing, but in the Love of her Creator. And 'tis no wonder, that thoſe comfortable Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhe receiv'd, in theſe Viſits of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved; made her deſirous of a nearer and ſtricter Union with him, by a dayly Communion. But becauſe it was not the Cuſtom of the Convent, ſhe contented her ſelf with exerciſing the higheſt Act of Conformity; which is, <hi>To leave God for God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By theſe Devotions we may imagine, how well ſhe ſpent her time before the Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; and by what follows, the means whereby ſhe obtain'd theſe comfortable Inſpirations: For if we regard her comportment, whilſt ſhe was in the Quire; we ſhall find that ſhe was never taken notice of, to ſpeak to any one; no, not to the Superior her ſelf. Her Modeſty and Cuſtody of her Eyes, were no leſs Inſtrumental than her Silence; for the obtaining a perpetual Communication with God. And thô the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity never perceiv'd her Eyes off the Book, in time of the Divine Office; yet what they
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56701:69"/>extreamly wonder'd at; was, that if any thing were wanting in the Quire; none ſooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it than ſhe, nor could be more ready to fetch it; which made all believe, that ſhe had a particular Inſpiration at thoſe times, of what was wanting.</p>
                     <p>When any thing requir'd her Preſence, or Aſſiſtance out of the Quire, in time of Divine Office; ſhe was ſo faithful, in a Pious Recital of it afterwards; that nothing could make her haſten, or run it over, faſter than ordinary: In which ſhe found ſuch comfort; that not content with the dayly Obligation, that all Religious have to recite it; ſhe bound her ſelf by a particular Vow, to a conſtant performance of this Religious Duty. And was ſo ſtrongly toucht in Reading it, that once Mother Abbeſs taking notice, that in time of the Office ſhe wept extreamly, askt her, <hi>If any thing troubled her?</hi> Whereupon, ſhe Anſwer'd, <hi>That her want of due compliance, with what she had promis'd God a careful performance of, was that which afflicted her.</hi> This Anſwer fill'd Reverend Mother Abbeſs with amazement, who had always been an Eye Witneſs of her conſtant and exact performance of this obligation; having often obſerv'd, that ſhe ſeem'd always to be, as it were rapt, in the Preſence of God, whilſt ſhe recited it. For as her Interior ſeem'd to be totally fixt upon Heaven, ſo her Exterior was ſo fortified againſt diſtractions, by a ſtrict guard over her Senſes; that 'twas almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that ſhe ſhould be the leaſt defective
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56701:69"/>in this her promiſe to Almighty God; Wherefore, theſe Tears were undoubtedly, rather a Mark of the Purity of her Conſcience, and an effect of thoſe Spiritual Guſts, with which his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had repleniſht her Soul, as a reward of her Fidelity; than a ſign of any neglect of her Duty; as her Humility mov'd her to apprehend.</p>
                     <p>One would think, that this rigorous ſilence, this exact cuſtody of ſenſes, and this continual Recollection, would have render'd her Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, leſs diverting at thoſe times when Obedience gave liberty to ſpeak, and made her leſs diſpos'd, to help towards the innocent Recreation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But they were ſo far from it, that never any effects of dulneſs or melancholly were obſerv'd in her. And 'twas at all times an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to her, to ſee any appearance of what lookt Moroſe or miſ-becoming, in any of the Religious, and much more in her ſelf; and when ſhe perceiv'd by any ones looks, the leaſt ſign of melancholly or diſcontent; ſhe us'd her utmoſt endeavours to divert them, in particular. God had been very liberal in giving her a ſweet and obliging Nature, and ſhe was reſolv'd never to hinder it's courſe; but diſpence thoſe Talents as liberally, as ſhe had receiv'd them. This made her Humor affable, her Converſation attractive, and extreamly welcome to all. And the Religious were us'd to ſay of her, That ſhe perfectly imitated St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s example: <hi>Omnibus omnia facta, becoming all to all.</hi> So chearful, ſo pleaſant, and ſo condeſcending to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ones capacity and humor, was this good Novice.</p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:56701:70"/>
                     <p>This comportment of hers depended purely upon the good Judgment, which God had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon her; which gave her a happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in all her Actions; and ſuch an inſight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the humors, and conſtitutions, of thoſe ſhe converſt with; that thereby, ſhe qualified her ſelf, for all forts of Tempers. She Knew when to be free in Recreation, and yet never to abuſe that freedom: She could preſently diſcern what ſort of Spiritual Diſcourſe (for they never us'd any other) was moſt agreeable to the Genius of the Perſons preſent; and this circumſpection, not only gave her an extraordinary command over her ſelf; but alſo a great Authority and Power, with thoſe ſhe kept company withal. It was a Prerogative ſingular to her ſelf, to be at once free and prudent, chearful and circumſpect, graceful and enfie, to be eſteem'd and reſpected, and to be lov'd and reverenc'd, by thoſe who were moſt familiar with her.</p>
                     <p>Nor can I reſt ſatisfied with this general Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter I have given of her Humor; but muſt deſcend to thoſe particulars, which the Religious have given me: Who took notice, that whatever difficulty or indiſpoſition ſhe ſuffer'd, ſhe ingeniouſly diſſembl'd them in time of Recreation: Being always reſolv'd, to uphold and maintain the hour alotted to this innocent Paſtime; by a proviſion which ſhe had made, of ſuch pleaſant Spiritual Stories; as ſerv'd not only to divert the hearers, but excite them to the Love of God: Yet was never known to expreſs even the leaſt
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56701:70"/>ſign of impatience whilſt others related theirs; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no inclination to ingroſs the Diſcourſe to her ſelf, in which ſhe carefully wav'd whatever in the leaſt related to her ſelf or Family. Her punctual obſervance of the Conſtitutions in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpiritually, was the more wonder'd eat by the Community; becauſe ſhe having been a Perſon in the World, whoſe Quality and Education, muſt neceſſarily have furniſht her with many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary paſſages, the Relation of which would have been very diverting; yet nothing was ever heard from her Mouth, which tended not either to the Praiſe of Virtue, or to the Love of God. Neither did the energy, with which ſhe ſpoke of Heavenly things, give any trouble or Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at all, to thoſe that heard her; no more than their Diſcourſes did ever give her; which appear'd by that conſtant and extraordinary ſerenity of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſhe particularly ſeem'd to put on, in time of Recreation: Which was hereby no leſs promoted, and animated by her, whilſt others ſpoke, than when ſhe ſpoke her ſelf. But whilſt with a conſtant and un-interrupted Progreſs, ſhe thus chearfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd in the pl aſant path of Perfection; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold God (who knew her fidelity) permitted a great and unexpected Storm, to be rais'd againſt her; ſo much the more ſenſible, becauſe it depriv'd her not only of a near Relation; but by his Death oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd a delay of that happineſs, ſelf ſo much thirſted after, and thought her ſelf, even ready to poſſeſs; <hi>Viz.</hi> that of her Profeſſion, or Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals with Chriſt.</p>

In his way to <hi>Liege,</hi> as he paſſed through the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> he Viſited ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Houſes; and amongſt others, the <hi>English Carthuſians</hi> at <hi>Newport:</hi> Where the admirable order and chearfulneſs, he beheld amongſt them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt ſo great Solitude and Auſterity; had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, by the influence of Gods Grace, ſo toucht his Heart; that he reſolv'd to follow his Brothers example in quitting the World; as ſoon as he could compaſs it, by a ſettlement of his Affairs in <hi>England:</hi> But ſaid nothing of this his deſign, till one Night at <hi>Liege,</hi> he and his Brother being alone together, he ask'd to borrow his ſquare Cap; which, pulling of his Periwig, he put on; asking his Brother, <hi>If it became him:</hi> Who Anſwer'd, <hi>That it became him very well, and that he did not doubt, but if God gave him inclinations to a Religious State, that he would find the ſame happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſatisfaction in it, as he himſelf had done.</hi> Mr. <hi>Francis VVarner</hi> hereupon, reply'd with Tears, <hi>That he was ſorry he had not profited by his Education at School, as he wisht he had done; ſince by reaſon of this neglect, he could not now be ſo happy, as to be his Brother alſo in Religion:</hi> But added, <hi>That he had made a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of becoming a</hi> Carthuſian; <hi>in which Order, Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was not ſo abſolutely neceſſary, as in the</hi> Society: <hi>VVhere they tended, not only to their own Perfection; but alſo to the Perfection of their Neighbor: And that he doubted not, but that he should meet with the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent amongſt the</hi> Carthuſians; <hi>which he expreſt, to have already experienc'd in the</hi> Society: <hi>VVherefore he reſolv'd
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56701:72"/>to haſten back to</hi> England; <hi>there to ſettle his Eſtate, and to take</hi> Graveling <hi>and</hi> Watten <hi>in his way thither; and that at the laſt place, he deſign'd to make the Spiritual Exerciſe; to ſee whether this Vocation to be a</hi> Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian, <hi>were from God or no; and if he found it were, that he might thereby be ſtrengthen'd, to overcome all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles, that should oppoſe or retard the execution, of what God had inſpir'd him to undertake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may well imagine how overjoy'd Brother <hi>Clare</hi> was at this welcome, thô un-exſpected News; and with what ſeaſonable Counſels, he ſeconded his Brothers Pious intentions: Who reſolving forthwith to leave <hi>Liege,</hi> Brother <hi>Clare</hi> deſir'd him, to take his two Daughters, who were ſtill with the <hi>Vrſulins,</hi> along with him; to conduct them to the <hi>English</hi> Monaſtry of <hi>Benedictine</hi> Dames at <hi>Gant:</hi> Whether he carry'd them very ſafe. Hence he continu'd his Journy towards <hi>Graveling;</hi> both to Viſit his Siſters there, and to give them an account of the welfare of his Neeces, and of their removal from <hi>Liege</hi> to <hi>Gant.</hi> You may imagine how overjoy'd they were to ſee him; but the joy his preſence gave them, was nothing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of that which the welcome news, of his deſign of leaving the World occaſion'd. From thence he went to <hi>VVatten,</hi> where he made Eight Days Exerciſe: In which retirement, by the light and unction of the Holy Ghoſt, he was thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinc'd, that his Vocation unto the Holy Order of <hi>Carthuſians,</hi> was an Inſpiration from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Wherefore, having ended his retreat, he haſten'd to <hi>Newport;</hi> as well once more to take a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56701:72"/>a view of that place, in which he reſolv'd to end his Life; as to Embark from thence for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſtay'd here longer than he intended, in expectation of fair weather; but it continu'd Stormy ſo very long, that his impatience, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the happy State he aim'd at, caus'd him to urge the Maſter of the Packet-boat, to venter out to Sea, in that Stormy weather. The Maſter, overcome by his earneſt intreaties and large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, hoiſted Sail; but inſtead of ſteering out of the Harbor, fell foul on a Sand banck; where the Veſſel ſtuck ſo faſt, that the flowing Tide quickly fill'd it with Water; and the boiſterous Waves waſht thoſe over Deck, who came up to ſave their Lives: Amongſt theſe was Mr. <hi>VVarner,</hi> who as the Waves carry'd him into the Sea, cry'd out to thoſe, who to ſave themſelves were got upon the Shrouds; conjuring them, if they eſcap't, to let the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> know the manner of his Death; and how earneſtly he deſir'd, they would Pray for the Repoſe of his Soul. Some few that eſcaped, after the Tide was fallen ſo low as to permit them, acquainted the good Fathers with his earneſt requeſt; which they not only granted, by Praying for his Soul; but expreſt the greatneſs of their Charity, by an earneſt ſearch after his Body; which that it might be the better found out, they gave a diſcription of the Rings, they had obſerv'd upon his fingers: Which being brought by a Seaman, to a Goldſmith to be Sold; the Goldſmith found them to be the ſame, the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56701:73"/>
                     <hi>Carthuſians</hi> had deſcrib'd to him; and told the Perſon that brought them, that if he would diſcover where the Body was, he would procure him a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that ſhould not be inferior to the value of the Rings; which he undertaking to do, the Goldſmith order'd him, to acquaint the Procurator of the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> where it was; who went with him to the Sea-ſhore, where he uncover'd the Body, he had buried in the Sand: Which they knew to be Mr. <hi>VVarner</hi>'s, by it's wanting thoſe fingers the Seaman had cut off, not being able otherwiſe to get off his Rings. The <hi>Carthuſians</hi> preſently took care, decently to Bury his Body amongſt their own Religious; he having plainly declar'd himſelf a <hi>Carthuſian</hi> in deſire; thô Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence permitted not, his being one in effect: Whoſe innocent Life, deſerv'd as a reward, a Death; which thô ſuddain, ſhould not be un-prepar'd. It happen'd on the 3d. of <hi>April</hi> 1667.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the Diſcourſe I have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, with the Relation of this paſſage; his ſuddain and unexpected Death was a double Mortification and affliction to Siſter <hi>Clare;</hi> firſt, for the loſs of ſo near a Relation, for whom ſhe had a very particular eſteem; ſecondly, becauſe by his Death her Profeſſion would neceſſarily be defer'd: She evidently foreſeeing, that this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate accident; would coſt Brother <hi>Clare</hi> a Journy into <hi>England,</hi> in order to make a new ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Eſtate, which could not poſſibly be diſpatcht, by the Month of <hi>August;</hi> which was the time prefixt for the folemn making of their Vows.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56701:73"/>But the ſame hand that ſent theſe Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, intended them as a tryal to improve their Merit; and for that end, largely diſtributed his Divine Grace, to encourage them to a chearful Reſignation.</p>
                  <p>The neceſſity therefore of making another ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement, ſummon'd Brother <hi>Clare</hi> to <hi>England;</hi> and forced him with ſorrow to re-aſſume his Title, together with his Eſtate; and with them thoſe troubleſome concerns, from which he had a little before, ſo happily diſengag'd himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Being come to <hi>London,</hi> the Enemy reſolv'd to give him as uneaſie a welcome, as he had had a Journy thither; for his Steward (to whom he had given notice of his arrival) ſent an expreſs to inform him, that he himſelf was put in Priſon; that his Houſe had been ſearch'd by Order of the Lord Lieutenant of the County; that they had taken away all the Arms they found; and had ſet a Guard upon it. This fell out about the ſame time that the <hi>Dutch</hi> deſign'd to Land in <hi>England,</hi> and appear'd upon the Coaſts of <hi>Suffolk;</hi> about Seven Miles diſtant from his Houſe: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſome Malitious Perſons gave out, that he was privately come into England, and lay hid in his own Houſe at <hi>Parham,</hi> with a great many more Papiſts, he had brought along with him to joyn the <hi>Dutch.</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> (whoſe Family as well as himſelf, had always been Loyal Sufferers for the King) was more concern'd to be accus'd of ſuch black Crimes, as Treaſon and Rebellion were; than he would have been, for any other
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56701:74"/>accuſation, they could have laid to his charge. Wherefore, he went immediatly to a friend and Neighbor of his, then in <hi>London,</hi> and Major of the Kings Guards; deſiring him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his Majeſty, with what had paſt; but the Major thought it more proper to accompany him to the Counteſs of <hi>Suffolk;</hi> to acquaint her with what had been done by her Husbands, the Lord Lieutenants Order. They went together to my Lady, whom the Major inform'd of all that had paſt; and moreover aſſur'd her Ladyſhip; the King would not be well pleas'd ſhould he hear of theſe proceedings, againſt a Perſon of whoſe Fidelity and Loyalty he was convinc'd; and for which he himſelf was ready to Anſwer. Upon the Majors Teſtimony, my Lady Writ a Letter to her Husband the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> in which ſhe acquainted him of what the Major had inform'd her; deſiring him to make Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> what amends he could, for what, by his Authority had been acted againſt him; which Letter ſhe gave to Sir <hi>Iohn;</hi> who immediatly took Poſt, and deliver'd it himſelf the next Morning to my Lord; from whom he receiv'd as good effects of it, as could be expected; for my Lord gave him preſently an Order, for the taking his Steward out of Priſon; for the diſcharge of the Guards, that were ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Houſe; and for the Reſtitution of his Arms. My Lord moreover aſſur'd him, that the former Orders he had given, were rather to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his Houſe from the Rabble, that threatned to pull it down; than out of the leaſt ſuſpition,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56701:74"/>or doubt of his Loyalty. Moſt of the Informers and chief Actors in this buſineſs, living at <hi>Fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingham,</hi> a Mile beyond his Houſe, he choſe firſt to go thither; leſt the news of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his Houſe, might give a ſecond alarum, and create new troubles. Upon his way, he met ſeveral Gentlemen of his acquaintance, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him to the Town aforeſaid; where he was no ſooner enter'd, but the chief Inhabitants came to Congratulate his arrival: Expreſſing their ſorrow, for what had happen'd in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and deſiring him not to believe any of them the cauſe of it: And moreover, manifeſted their joy for his return, by Ringing of the Bells.</p>
                  <p>This ſecond Storm the Enemy had rais'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus happily appeas'd; Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> return'd to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> there to make a ſettlement of his Eſtate, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſecond, and now only Brother, Mr. <hi>Edmund VVarner,</hi> a Merchant in <hi>London.</hi> Here Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> met with hit Father-in-law, Sir <hi>Thomas Hanmer,</hi> to whom he gave an account, how he deſign'd to ſettle his Eſtate; telling him, he intended, inſtead of the Six Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pound, which according to the Articles of Marriage, he was oblig'd to give his Daughters, to ſettle upon them the Mannor of <hi>Boyton,</hi> worth Four Hundred Pound a Year. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of taking kindly this great addition to his Grand-childrens Portions, as Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> expected he would have done, declar'd; that he lookt upon theſe Lands, he deſign'd to give them, as next to nothing; becauſe they were Abby Lands, which never thrive with the owners; but like a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56701:75"/>Moth, by little and little inſenſiblely eat up the reſt of their Eſtates. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> told him moreover, that he eaſily perceiv'd what his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was, in giving theſe Lands to his Daughters; <hi>Viz.</hi> That out of a Scruple of Poſſeſſing them, they ſhould be in a manner forc't to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Nuns; that thereby they might reſtore them to the Roman Catholic Church, to which they formerly belong'd. Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> wonder'd that a Proteſtant as Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was, ſhould Scruple at the Poſſeſſing of ſuch Lands, or have a doubt of the juſt Title of their owners; which that he might free him from, Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> gave him the ſame Anſwer he had receiv'd, from his Maſter of Novices, in the like doubt; <hi>Viz. That theſe Lands came not to his Anceſtors by gift, but by Purchaſe; and that the Pope had given Cardinal</hi> Pool, <hi>his Legat, in the Reign of Queen Mary, Permiſsion to diſpence even with Catholics, to enjoy Abby-Lands.</hi> But theſe Reaſons not ſatisfying Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> as they had himſelf; Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> promis'd him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage other Lands for the Payment of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Portions, in ready Mony; and gave order to his Lawyer to make the ſettlement accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt he was thus buſied in getting the Writings ingroſt, the Enemy ſtill to retard the execution of his deſign, to which the ſettelment was a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary means; rais'd another Storm, far different from the former, and far more ſurprizing and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting; by reaſon he made uſe of his Lady to do it; and mov'd her alſo, by ſuch pretences,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56701:75"/>as were ſo much the more dangerous, by how much they carried an appearance of Piety along with them: And conſequently were the more apt to deceive her, who ſought no leſs Gods greater Glory, than her own greater contempt in all things. Of all which Father <hi>Martin Green,</hi> then Rector of <hi>VVatten,</hi> inform'd Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> by a Letter, in which he alſo deſir'd him to deſiſt from making any further ſettlement, till he had heard again from him; becauſe the Enemy being not a little buſie in diſquieting Siſter <hi>Clare;</hi> he knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Malice might not end, in perſwading her to return again to the World; having by crafty pretences diſſatisfied her with the place, where ſhe was. In the mean time Father <hi>Thomas VVorſley</hi> went to <hi>Graveling</hi> (who had been for ſome time her Director) to try if he could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate ſuch difficulties, as the Enemy had rais'd and endeavour'd to foment; not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like thoſe he had ſuggeſted at <hi>Liege; Viz.</hi> That God call'd her ſtill to a ſtricter Order, than this was; that here ſhe found too much eſteem and reſpect; and therefore it would be more grateful to God to go amongſt Strangers; where ſhe might be freed from the too great civility, and kindneſs, ſhe experienc'd amongſt the <hi>English:</hi> That there were Orders ſtill ſtricter than this, where ſhe could find no impediment of entering, as ſhe did among the <hi>Carthuſianeſſes.</hi> Hereupon, ſhe Mortified her ſelf above what the Rule al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, thinking a Liberty in that kind lawful, and upon this, gave what ſcope ſhe was able to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56701:76"/>thoſe Auſterities, to which this Rigorous, but falſe Spirit drew her, upon pretence to gain light from Heaven. All which without doubt could not be from God, ſince the Auſterity of this Rule was as great, as her ſtrength of Body was able to bear: And that you may the better judge of this, I will give you here a ſhort account of their ſtrict and ſevere manner of living.</p>
                  <p>The Convent is Commodiouſly and Neatly Built, but a true Emblem of Poverty: Their Cells are not long enough, for one of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Stature to lye at full length; and therefore, when they ſleep they almoſt ſit upright in their Beds; which are not two foot and a half broad; and the Cell is no broader, beſides what the Bed takes up, than to give room, enough for a ſingle perſon to go in and out: All their furniture, is a little low Stool to ſit upon, and a Straw-bed and Bolſter (or if Sick a Pillow of Chaff) upon which they lye in their Habits, having a Blanket to cover them. They wear no Linnen; go bare-foot, having on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sandals; riſe at Midnight; abſtain all their life time from Fleſh; and keep ſuch a Faſt all the Year, except Sundays, as we do in Lent. Their Cells were then only ſeparated with Bricks, without any Plaiſtring upon them, but the preſent Biſhop of St, <hi>Omers,</hi> in his laſt Viſit, gave order to have them Plaiſter'd. Their Tables in the Refectory are never cover'd, and they Eat only in Earthen Diſhes. Notwithſtanding this extream Poverty, the Neatneſs that is obſerv'd in their Dormitory,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56701:76"/>Quire, Refectory and Cell; is ſuch, as Charms the Eyes of all, that by the Biſhops leave, are permitted to enter: And the chearfulneſs of theſe Mortified Souls, their freſh colour, the healthful and youthful looks even of Ancient Perſons, are ſuch; as ſtrike admiration into thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and converſe with them. One would have imagin'd, that Siſter <hi>Clare</hi> needed not to have thought of any other Rigorous Life, than what ſhe found here; and that ſhe could not think of greater Auſterity, than was here practis'd. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, at length Father <hi>VVorſley,</hi> convinced her, that this ſeeming Call to greater Mortification, was only a deceit of the Enemy, to hinder her from the happineſs of a Religious State, ſhe ſo much deſir'd to embrace: Which he endeavour'd firſt to make her defer, that he might have the more time to exerciſe his Malicious deſign upon her, of making her quite lay aſide, what ſhe had ſo Piouſly undertaken. Theſe Reaſons ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully mov'd her, that howſoever cunningly the Train was laid by the Enemy, it took no effect; for ſhe, following the advice of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour, reſolv'd for the future to regard ſuch thoughts as Temptations; and that nothing hereafter ſhould ever hinder her from a ſpeedy execution of what ſhe had before ſo earneſtly deſir'd; <hi>Viz.</hi> The making of her Profeſſion in this place. Whereupon, finding again that Peace of Mind return, ſhe had loſt, ever ſince ſhe had given way to theſe Temptations; ſhe was mov'd to expreſs her ſubmiſſion to the Will of God, declar'd to her by
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56701:77"/>her Confeſſour, in this following, humble and ſubmiſſive Act; which finding in her own hand amongſt her Papers, I thought it would not be ungrateful to the Reader, to ſet it down at large, having a Scruple to ſhorten what I found ſo ſolid and moving.</p>

Nor could I here be content, but muſt ſtill be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering (thô my God you know I thought it was to pleaſe you more) being ſo deluded and blinded, as to make my own choice, and reverſe the Doom, that you had fixt; till you put me again into the right way.

Wean my Soul from all deſires, that may contradict your Will; make me ready to forſake my own Senſe, trample ſelf-love under my feet, and wholy transform my Will into yours. Give me patience to ſuffer, any injuries,

I deſerve worſe than what I have named, and I deſire to ſuffer more; that I may have the more reſemblance to my ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Savior, whom by my tranſgreſſions I have ſo often Crucified.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56701:79"/>ſhe could not be ſo far ignorant of his Affection, as to think, that to make himſelf happy, he would expoſe her to ſo great a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, as the entring into that State againſt her Will, would occaſion; and therefore as he had left the World purely in obedience to what he thought God's Call, and not out of any want of that reciprocal Affection, he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to have for her; ſo, unleſs ſhe had the ſame content in this State, as he had found; he ſhould not look upon it as a real Call from God, but as a tryal only that Almighty God had given him, of his Obedience; ſeeing, that promiſe he had made to her in Marriage, oblig'd him not to make that ſeparation they were about, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her free and full conſent; and therefore, deſir'd her freely to diſcover her Mind to him, aſſuring her; whatever it was, it ſhould not in the leaſt leſſen that conſtant Affection, ſhe had ever receiv d from him.</p>
                  <p>This Letter came not to her hands, till after ſhe had taken a Reſolution of ſtaying, and making her Profeſſion at <hi>Graveling,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, underſtanding the trouble he was in (which was a great affliction to her) ſhe immediately Anſwers his Letter, to put him out of that pain, which the Letter he had receiv'd from Father <hi>Green,</hi> concerning her deſires to remove from <hi>Graveling,</hi> had occaſion'd.</p>

I receiv'd your Letter, and Read it with that liberty you deſir'd, and now An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you with the ſame freedom; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I beſeech you be aſſur'd, that all I ſhall ſay comes from my heart, as ſpeaking in the preſence of God, and without conſideration of any Creature. And first as to my ſelf, after beging upon my Knees, that you will forgive me the infinite loſs of time, and trouble I have caus'd you, both in Spiritual and Temporal concerns; I do aſſure you by Gods great mercy, I deſire nothing in this World, but to make my Profeſsion in this Bleſſed Order and Houſe; and that without the least motive ariſing from you, or any thing imaginable but God's holy Will; who of his unſpeakable Goodneſs has himſelf as it were (if I may preſume to ſay ſo) plac'd me here, where I may truly ſerve him. I hope ſince he has given me this real deſire, he will be pleas'd to move this Holy Community, to accept of me, thô he knows how unworthy I am of it; but I have not as yet beg'd that Voices. I cannot but think Gods Mercy, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56701:80"/>your Induſtry will ſoon compaſs an end of all Affairs; ſo that we may ſoon make our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion. Now as to Temporal buſineſs, I do not only from the bottom of my Soul reſign all right to what you of your Charity had given me, but to all the other Rights and Titles whatever, (except the Portion for this Houſe, agreed on at parting) and I bleſs God a Million of times, who gives me Grace and leave to do it. If I had as many Worlds it would be (as I hope) my first Act to leave them. I was not worthy to have been favor'd by God with great things, to have given them back again to him, but in giving you to my dear Savior (which I do with all my Soul, and with all joy and thankfulneſs, to his Infinite Goodneſs, who gave me this Grace) I must needs ſay, that I preſent him more, than Riches can comprehend: And if I would have beg'd of God, to have given me one, of whom I might have made a most perfect Sacrifice, and in whom I only, and purely liv'd by Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

Methinks I ought to aſſure my ſelf he would not have given you theſe tryals (which I know have been very great and ſevere) but that out of his endleſs Love, he intended at the ſame time to ſhew his ſtrength in you, and make you more his: Since you command me, I shall most earnestly beg of him, that he will ſo unite you to himſelf, that you become that, for which alone you were Created: And I beſeech you to beg this for me, that I may be dead to all Creatures, as well as to my ſelf, and live only to, and in him.

My Lady having no notice at all of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, prudently judg'd it unfit to meddle in the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56701:82"/>matter, doubting whether they came from Sir <hi>Iohn;</hi> ſince they neither brought any Letter from him; nor had ſhe receiv'd any other way notice of their coming, or of the buſineſs they came about, than from their own Mouths. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Mr. <hi>Parmentier</hi> return'd to <hi>London;</hi> from whence he was immediately ſent back with ſuch Letters, as caus'd a ſpeedy diſpatch of this Affair.</p>
                  <p>All things being thus upon the Point of a full and happy concluſion; there was another un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſeen difficulty, which could not ſo ſuddenly be remov'd.

                        <p>HAving firſt beg'd of our Bleſſed Savior, to direct me concerning the Children, I muſt tell you my thoughts en all ſides, and crave your's, concerning what I write; that we may joyntly reſolve upon what is to be done. I have ſeriouſly conſider'd our Obligation of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up either for the World, or Religion; and I find they cannot poſsibly learn any thing, that is material, as to Worldly breeding, till they be Eleven or Twelve Years of Age; and am therefore apt to think, they will be as well here if not better, for Four or Five Years, than in any place elſe: I ſpeak in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of them, and not of my ſelf. I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many apprehenſions, concerning what I propoſe: For if they be here, and I should hear they were not well, or they should complain of any thing that might happen to them, 'twould be a cauſe of disturbance, not only to my own Soul, but might probably make me troubleſome, both to my Superior, and the Community; and this perhaps without the leaſt redreſs to the poor Children. Moreover, should they be here, and not ſpeak privately to me (which truly if they do, will be no ſmall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and diſtraction to the quiet and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if my Soul) how should I come to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56701:83"/>know, if they were contented, or if they wanted any thing fitting for them, or not. Whereas, if they are in another place, ſome one whom God ſhould inſpire with that Charity, might take the liberty at leaſt to acquaint you or me with it. But yet on the other ſide, when I conſider the care that our most dear and Reverend Mother Abbeſs, as well as the rest of this Holy Family, will undoubtedly have of them; I do not ſee any cauſe of this fear: Therefore what I chiefly apprehend (and propoſe to you as in the Preſence of God) is my own disturbance, without any profit to them: I conceive the best way to avoid this, if you think fit to let them come hither, will be, to have them here, as if I were not here my ſelf; and I shall endeavour to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine it ſo: For 'tis impoſſible I should have any thing to do in their dayly concerns, with any repoſe of mind; yet if any thing extraordinary should happen to them, I may be conſulted here, as I should be, were they in another place. I think if they come hither, 'tis neceſſary, that they should have a good careful Servant, and I am ſure you will be very circumſpect in chooſing ſuch a one. I hope the Widdow <hi>Draper,</hi> if you can prevail with her to leave her Family, might prove a fit one for them. I have no ſuch deſign, nor never had, as your Letter mentions; that they should wear this
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56701:84"/>Habit, as heretofore Convictriſſes in this place have done: For I deſire they should wear no Religious Habit, till God Cloaths them with one. As to their Portions, I need not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to your Care. I hope I may have your Anſwer ſo ſoon; as that they may be here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Profeſsion, if you approve of their coming.</p>

I have Writ my Father word, that 'tis very hard he should deſire to take them from me, to put them under the Tuition of another: And now I humbly deſire your Ladiship, to aſsist me in making good this Argument, by ſending the Children to me. I confeſs yen muſt have a great deal of goodneſs, to pardon my boldneſs in being thus tedious; but it proceeds from an earneſt deſire, that you should not think, I remove them upon any apprehenſion, that they wanted

                  <p>This Civil Letter was kindly receiv'd by the Lady Abbeſs of <hi>Gant,</hi> who made an addition to her former favors by the kind entertainment ſhe gave the Gentleman: For being of ſo obliging a Nature, as that a removal of the Children from her ſight, could not remove them from her heart; ſhe thought ſhe could not give a better demonſtration of her Love, than by complying with what their Friends thought beſt for them. This made her part with the Children, with ſo much chearfulneſs, and ſatisfaction, as put the good Paſtor into admiration. The proſpect ſhe had of their being Fortunes, and of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of their entring amongſt them, if they ſtay'd there; could not ſo far enter into her thoughts, as to cauſe a regret at their departure: Which is a great confirmation of that worth, prudence, and generoſity; which all that know her Ladiſhip, not without reaſon, admire her for.</p>
                  <p>When they came away, the Confeſſor of the Monaſtry ſent this Character along with them, in a Letter to Siſter <hi>Clare.</hi> That Mrs. <hi>Catherine</hi> (who was the Elder) had ſo Edified the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious with her ſingular Devotion, Piety, and ſweet behaviour; that they were all enamour'd with her; and that he believ'd they were both predeſtinated not only to be Religious, but to be great Saints: For he had never ſeen ſuch early tokens of both, as they gave. Thus in ſucceeding Years, was that part of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Letter, ſo far fulfilled, that they became
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56701:86"/>Religious: As to the other part, their Modeſty will not permit me to enlarge upon their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and ſo muſt be ſilent; ſince they are now actually living, and Profeſt in that Honorable, and Floriſhing Community, of <hi>English Benedictine</hi> Dames at <hi>Dunkirk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the 28th. of <hi>September,</hi> the Children came ſafe to <hi>Graveling;</hi> and it was now above a Year ſince they had ſeen Siſter <hi>Clare;</hi> yet neither length of time, nor the diſguiſe of a poor and abject Habit, was able to ſteal away the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſo dear a Mother; wherefore, they ran to her, and with all the little haſty joy they were able to expreſs, hung about her Neck, often kiſſing her, and making a Thouſand inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent expreſſions of fondneſs, and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her. She in the mean time, to the great amazement of all preſent; did not ſuffer her ſelf to be in the leaſt carry'd away, with the pleaſing violence of their endearments; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, remain'd unmov'd, juſt as if Nature had been as dead in her, as ſhe deſir'd to be to the World. Her conſtancy in the Love of God was not to be ſhaken by the tender and redoubled expreſſions of her Children; nor did ſhe in the leaſt ſhow any ſymptom of fondneſs or tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of paſſion towards them; thinking it a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, after the Sacrifice ſhe had made of them to God, to give way to her former Affections, or feelings of Nature. This made her receive all their innocent Careſſes, without the leaſt return: Which, as ſome of the Religious confeſt, was a ſtrange
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56701:87"/>check, to their ſenſibility; which they could not help, whilſt they beheld this more than human comportment of Siſter <hi>Clare</hi> towards her Children: Knowing ſhe lov'd them as much, as it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any Mother to do; by ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular paſſage they had obſerv'd in her; which paſſion ſhe ſo ſtrangely ſtifl'd in this moving circumſtance, that it ſtruck them with the greater admiration. Love generally ſpeaks in others, from every part; but in Siſter <hi>Clare</hi> of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> this powerful Orator became dumb; Love conquer'd Love, the Energy of that, ſilenc't this, and the Mother gave place to the Saint.</p>
                  <p>As their arrival was a tryal of her Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, ſo it prov'd the Teſt of her Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to her Superior, his Vice-gerent; for they were no ſooner come, than ſhe had that task put upon her, which ſhe ſo much dreaded; <hi>Viz.</hi> the taking care of them. To this ſhe moſt ſubmiſſively yielded, thô nothing could more thwart her inclinations. She had obtain'd at <hi>Liege,</hi> that her Children ſhould not come to her; but at <hi>Graveling</hi> ſhe muſt ſuffer this Mortification, of giving more way to Nature, than ſhe deſir'd: But God ſaw her now more able to bear the one, and to reſiſt the other: Thô ſhe, to prevent the exerciſe of this care of her Children, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently beg'd to be Scullion in the Kitchin, and ſuch like humble Offices; which Mother Abbeſs ſtill put off, by telling her. <hi>VVhen they were able to take care of themſelves, then she should be employed in ſuch Offices as theſe; but till then she must think that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56701:87"/>employment moſt pleaſing to God, which Obedience put upon her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As ſoon as Sir <hi>Iohn VVarner</hi> receiv'd the news of his Daughters arrival at <hi>Graveling,</hi> he made what haſt he could thither, to accompliſh that, which above all things in this World, he had ſo much long'd for; <hi>Viz.</hi> his Profeſſion: Where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arriv'd, he was receiv'd with all expreſſions of joy and kindneſs on all ſides; and finding Father <hi>Thomas VVorſley</hi> ſtill at <hi>Graveling</hi> (whither he went for the comfort and aſſiſtance of Siſter <hi>Clare</hi>) he Writ to Father <hi>Green</hi> the Rector of <hi>VVatten,</hi> now his Superior, to know whether it would not be convenient, that they ſhould make their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions together at <hi>Graveling;</hi> and if ſo, whether he might not alſo make his Preparation here of Eight Days Exerciſe; under the conduct of Father <hi>VVorſley.</hi> Father <hi>Green</hi> conſented to both, and accordingly they began it. In the time of her retirement ſhe made this following Oblation of her ſelf to Chriſt Crucified: Which as I found amongſt her Papers, in her own hand, ſo I doubt not but you will find it well worth your Reading; and therefore thought good to ſet it down at large: Since it contains ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Acts, that the exerciſe of them, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly conduce to your comfort, and progreſs in Virtue, as they did to hers.</p>

O the only ſource of my Being, and well-being! O my Crucified Savior, the only price of my Redemption! How late do I come to refreſh my Thirſty Soul in thoſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Streams, that flow from your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Wounds? How long has my blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ignorance detained me from taſting the ſweets of theſe Heavenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights? A taſt of which, is only granted to Religious Souls. I come at length drawn by the Cords of your Divine Love; I come deveſted of all Creatures, that my whole affection may be plac'd upon you, my Creator, and Redeemer. O do not ſuffer alone, but fix me with you to your Croſs; do not reject a heart inflam'd with a deſire of pleaſing you, and only you. Accept a heart melting away with your Love: For I come to embrace your Croſs, bare and naked, which alone for the future, ſhall be my Inheritance. O
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56701:88"/>let me never be ſeparated from you: But if my Soul be not yet perfect enough, for this Holy Conjunction, let me bury all my imperfections in your Sacred Wounds. O Fire! O Flame! Burn and conſume my old defiled Garment, let me be purified in the Ocean of your pretious Blood; cleanſe my Soul throughly, and prepare an habitation in it for your ſelf. Frame it as you would have it, and then take full poſſeſſion of it; for I am cloſe linkt to your Croſs, by the ſtrong Chains, and Bonds of Charity. I am burnt in the fire of your Divine and pureſt Love, my heart is wounded with the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of your Sufferings, whereby you have purchaſed for me an infinite Treaſure of happineſs. But what have I done for you O Merciful Redeemer, or what can I do? Behold with the moſt intenſe affection of my Soul, I freely and intirely give you my ſelf, my life, and liberty, my Body and Soul, all that I am, have, or can hope for. I give you my deareſt Husband, Children and whatever is deareſt to me; and make this Oblation purely for love of you alone: For whoſe ſake I renounce and abandon all Right to them and all other Friends, Kindred,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56701:89"/>Riches, Honors, Eſteem, Health, and whatever Proſperity and Comfort, this World can afford me. I bequeath all to your free diſpoſal, for I am intirely yours. This is my final Reſolution, this my laſt Will and Teſtament. Come therefore, O beautiful beloved of my Soul, nothing but your dear ſelf ſhall hereafter have place in my heart; come therefore, and inrich it with your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence; enter into my Soul, cleanſe it throughly from all Terene Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; mould it a new, make it who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addicted to your holy Service, that it may never ceaſe to praiſe, and love you. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>Thus this Holy Novice intirely gave her ſelf, and all ſhe had to God, a moſt happy fruit of her Eight Days retirement. When ſhe had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd this Exerciſe, ſhe beg'd the Voices of the Community, and of each one of the Religious apart, that ſhe might be admitted to her Vows; to which ſhe added another very earneſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Petition; <hi>Viz.</hi> that ſhe might be ſo admitted to them, as neither to have Active or Paſſive Voice in Chapter. Every one granted her firſt requeſt, but of the ſecond, ſhe could not obtain a grant from any one; which was a very conſiderable allay to that joy, ſhe receiv'd by their kind condeſcention to her firſt Petition.</p>

                     <p>Brother <hi>Clare,</hi> who now with his Habit takes again that welcome Name, which he was forced for ſome time to lay aſide, thought it convenient to deſire leave to ſpeak with her alone, before they made their Profeſſion; that he might be aſſur'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe were intirely ſatisfied in the State, to which ſhe was about to tye her ſelf, by a perpetual obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wherefore, he conſulted Father <hi>VVorſley</hi> and Reverend Mother Abbeſs; who both thought his propoſition not only reaſonable, but neceſſary. Wherefore, the Night before their Profeſſion, they met at the Grate in the Quire; which was left open on purpoſe, that they might be aſſur'd, that there were no Witneſſes of what paſſed, but God and themſelves; and therefore take the greater liberty of freely declaring their Minds, to one another.</p>
                     <p>He asked her, <hi>VVhether her Reſolutions, which she had acquaint'd him with, in her laſt Letters ſtill continu'd? VVhether she was ſatisfi'd with that courſe of Life, she had undertaken, and with the place she was in? VVhether she still enjoy'd in every thing, that true, and ſolid peace of mind, that she expreſs'd in her laſt Letters? And aſſur'd her, that if she had any diſlike to the Poor</hi> Clare's, <hi>he would ſtill as willingly ſtay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Year, as he had done the laſt.</hi> Moreover told her, <hi>That if she repented her undertaking of this State of Life, she was now in, that it was ſtill in her Power to reaſſume her former condition; and that he was no leſs ready to return with her to the VVorld, if she deſir'd it, than he was to come out of it; knowing, that neither of them could enter into a Religious
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56701:90"/>State, without the full and free conſent of the other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>She was not long in making a generous return to theſe kind propoſals; and firſt thanking him moſt kindly for the offers he made, told him, <hi>She thought none liv'd more happily, or contentedly in the VVorld than he and she had done, or could Love each other better;</hi> yet ſaid ſhe, <hi>what affliction muſt the reflection upon this happineſſ occaſion, when we conſider how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary a Life, and how full of ſorrow and affliction that was, which our deareſt Savior led here upon Earth for our ſakes; and can we Love him, and not endeavour to expreſs our Loves, by being like him, in ſuffering for his ſake, as he did for ours? Alas, were we again in the VVorld, how long could we promise our ſelves the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it? How ſoon might Death ſeperate us, and how miſerable would the Surviver be? No Dear Brother</hi> Clare, <hi>let us never think more of the VVorld; let not one thought of thoſe falſe and painted delights it yeilds, ever enter into our hearts, or cauſe the leaſt regret of that happy promiſe, which both of us to Morrow, by God's aſſistance, deſign to make to his Infinite Goodneſs: I muſt confeſs I have hinder'd you ſeveral times from making theſe comfortable Vows, but I am reſolv'd now to ſecure you, from any future ſuſpence of this happineſs; the joyful hour of our Profeſsion, is all I long for; 'tis that alone which is able to make you ſatisfaction, for all the trouble I have given you, by being the occaſion you have ſo long defer'd it. This is what I deſire above all things, and is that alone which is able to give us true peace and happineſs whilſt we are here upon Earth; by placeing us in ſo pleaſant and ſecure a way to Heaven.</hi>

                     <p>Brother <hi>Clare</hi> was extreamly Edified, as well as overjoy'd at the hearing theſe her ferverous Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and took notice, that all the while they were together, ſhe never ſo much as caſt up her Eyes, to look upon him: Nor did he take any, notice of it to her; but afterwards underſtood the reaſon why ſhe did not look up, was becauſe that Mother Abbeſs, when ſhe order'd her to go to the Grate, ſaid, <hi>Go to Brother</hi> Clare, and not, <hi>go ſee Brother</hi> Clare, which her Superior never reflected upon, as judging that addition unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; ſince the giving her leave to ſpeak at the open Grate, included alſo a leave of ſeeing him ſhe ſpoke to; but ſo great was her love to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, that ſhe was not content unleſs it accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the very leaſt of her actions, nor would ſhe ſo much as even caſt an Eye (whatever natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations ſhe found in her ſelf to do it) without this ſecure, and unerring Guide, which ſhe knew could not deceive her.</p>
                     <p>Finding each other ſo well ſatisfied, in the State of Life they had undertaken, they wiſht one another all comfort in their next Days Sacrifice, and took their laſt leaves in this World, with hopes of a moſt joyful meeting in the next, in the enjoyment of ſo conſtant a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, as could not be allay'd by parting, or any other accident: Where a continual joy, an everlaſting and un-interrupted peace, ſhould Crown that Voluntary Sacrifice they made of that ſatisfaction, they might have promis'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this World; which thô it ſhould have

                  <p>
                     <hi>LEt our humble Petitions O Lord appear in thy preſence, and vouchſafe to bleſs thy Servant, to whom in thy Holy Name we give the Veil of Religion; and by the Interceſſion of the most bleſſed, and most glorious Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>of the Bleſſed Apostles St.</hi> Peter <hi>and St.</hi> Paul, <hi>St.</hi> Francis, <hi>St.</hi> Clare, <hi>and all the other Saints, grant her a perfect Converſion from the World; and ſo ferverous an obſervance of what she has undertaken; that in all her Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, Streights and Temptations, being encourag'd by thy Divine Conſolation; and by true Humility and Obedience, being founded in fraternal Charity; she may justly, piouſly and Chastly perform, what by thy aſſistance she does this Day promiſe; and thereby deſerve to enjoy with thee Everlasting Life. Who with the Father and Holy Ghost, livest and reignest, God World without end,</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>O <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who art the way, out of which none can come to the Father; we beſeech thy most benign Clemency, that thou wouldst lead this thy Servant, whom thou hast
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56701:96"/>drawn from Terrene and carnal deſires, into the ſecure way of regular Diſcipline; and ſince thou vouchſafeſt to call Sinners to thee, ſaying,</hi> Come unto me all ye, that labor, and I will refreſh you; <hi>grant that the Voice of this your Invitation, may have ſo much Power over her, as that laying down the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of her Sins, she may deſerve to taste how great, and good you are; and by this your Divine refection, be inabl'd to ſustain your Chastiſements for them: And as thou haſt vouchſaft to attest, ſaying,</hi> I know my Sheep, and my Sheep know me; <hi>acknowledge her for thine, and grant that she may ſo know thee, and follow thee, and only thee; that she may never give Ear to, or obey anothers Voice; who haſt promis'd, that whoſoever obeys and ſerves thee here, shall follow thee hereafter; who livest and reignest,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Then the Father bid the Bride repeate thrice the following words, out of the 118 <hi>Pſalm. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me according to thy promiſes, and I shall live, and do not diſappoint me of my expectation;</hi> which ſhe having done with a loud and diſtinct Voice, and the Abbeſs having as often Anſwer'd, <hi>My deareſt Daughter, let it be done unto you, according to your words;</hi> the Quire Anſwer'd, <hi>Amen.</hi> Then the Bride kneel'd down before the Abbeſs, and joyning her hands together, plac't them betwixt the Abbeſſes,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56701:97"/>and both their hands thus joyn'd, were tyed together with ſuch a Stole, as the Prieſt wears about his Neck at Maſs; and is a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of thoſe Cords, wherewith our Savior, out of Love to us, permitted himſelf to be bound in his Paſſion; and therefore, the Bride mov'd with a Memory of this his Love, permits her hands to be thus bound, to repreſent thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior bands, by which ſhe ties her ſelf whilſt ſhe makes her Sacred Vows; and her hands are alſo bound to Mother Abbeſſes, as a mark of that tye of Obedience to her Will, which ſhe undertook; and then with a loud and diſtinct Voice ſhe made her Profeſſion, as follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt. Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Siſter <hi>Clare of Ieſus,</hi> do Vow unto Almighty God, the moſt Glorious Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Our Holy Father St. <hi>Francis,</hi> Our Holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther St. <hi>Clare,</hi> unto all the Holy Saints, and to you Reverend Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abbeſs, and all your Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, that shall hold your Place, to obſerve, all the Day's of my Life, the Rule and Form of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56701:97"/>of the Poor Siſters of St. <hi>Clare,</hi> giv'n her by St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by Our Holy Father Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the IV. I Vow to live in OBEDIENCE, without PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRIETY in any thing, in CHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STITY alſo, and not to go out of INCLOSURE during my whole Life, according to the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſame Rule.</p>
                  <p>Then the Abbeſs ſaid, <hi>And I on the part of God, according to his Inviolable Decree, do promiſe you Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life; if you obſerve, what you have Vow'd.</hi> To which the Quire Anſwer'd, <hi>Amen.</hi> Then the Abbeſs ſaluted the Bride, and taking off her White Veil, put on a Black one; ſaying, <hi>Take Daughter this Sacred Veil, and wear it till you come before the Tribunal of the Eternal Iudge, to whom all Knees, both in Heaven and Earth, and Hell are bent; remember you have for ever taken leave of the World, and given, and united your ſelf wholy to Ieſus Chriſt, as to your beloved Spouſe; may he defend and protect you from all Evils, and receive you at length, into Eternal Life.</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>Then the Bride, with a loud Voice, recited the words of St. <hi>Agnes, He has put a Mark and Veil ever my Face, that I may admit no other Lover but himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:56701:98"/>
                  <p>Then the Abbeſs put on the Brides head a Crown, ſaying, <hi>Take my dear Siſter this Temporal Crown, as a certain pledge of that Eternal one, which your Divine Spouſe has prepar'd for you, if you be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him.</hi> After this, the Abbeſs alſo put a Ring on her Finger, ſaying, at the ſame time, <hi>My be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Daughter, take this Ring, as a Mark of that love and fidelity, which you ought inviolably to keep to your faithful Spouſe Ieſus Christ, as long as you love.</hi> To which the Bride Anſwer'd, with a high Voice, <hi>My Lord Ieſus Chriſt has engag'd me to him with his Ring, and adorn'd me as his Spouſe, with a Crown.</hi> Then the Abbeſs put into her hand a Crucifix, and ſaid, <hi>Receive here, and embrace your Spouſe; may he receive, bleſs, and preſerve both you and us, for ever,</hi> Amen. After ſhe had receiv'd the Crucifix, the Father recited the following Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>LOrd Ieſus Christ, who by the immenſe goodneſs of thy Purity, hast vouchſafed to Eſpouſe our Souls with an indiſſoluble band of Love, grant we beſeech thee, that this thy Servant being firmly engag'd by thy Ring of Faith, may become ſo constant, faithful, and devout a Spouſe in thy ſervice, as that she may firmly perſever in it to the end; who liveſt and reignest,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:56701:98"/>
                  <p>O <hi>God who by thy love hast inflam'd this thy Servant, and drawn her from the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the World, to the reward of ſo high a Calling; vouchſafe ſo to purifie her heart with thy preſence, and the infuſion of thy Divine Grace, that she may perſever in it; that being strengthen'd by thy aſſistance, she may be able to perform, what by thy Divine inſpirations she has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd, and by the execution hereof, happily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Eternal reward, thou hast promis'd thoſe that perſever in thy ſervice; through Christ our Lord,</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Prayers being ended, the Quire began to Sing the following, <hi>Reſponſal, The Kingdom of this VVorld, and all it's Ornaments, I have contemn'd for the Love of my Lord Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> Which having ended, they began the Hymn, <hi>Te Deum Laudamus;</hi> and whilſt they were Singing it, the Bride went round the Quire, and receiv'd the Embraces and Congratulations of all the Religious; then retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to her place, ſhe and the reſt of the Religious kneeling in their order, the Father recited that Verſe of the 67 Pſalm, <hi>Confirm O God, what thou haſt wrought in us;</hi> and then made a very moving Sermon, upon the following Text, out of the 9th. Pſalm, <hi>Sperent in te Domine, qui noverunt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men tuum: Let them hope in thee, O Lord, who know thy Name.</hi> In this Exhortation he Firſt,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56701:99"/>lay'd open the nature of this Action or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, they had perform'd; by evidencing, that a greater Act of hope could not be expreſs'd, then by a Voluntary Contempt of the preſent, but tranſitory Comforts of this World; in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe ſolid and inexplicable joys, whoſe durance was to be Eternal in the next. <hi>Believe me</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the vain hopes of the Earth are too poor and inconſiderable for ſo generous hearts, as yours are; the Kingdom of Heaven, as you have made out to Day, is only worthy of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, He ſhew'd there could be no way more Compendious, to Honor and Celebrate this great Feaſt of <hi>All-Saints,</hi> then by ſtriving to make themſelves conformable to thoſe Great O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginals; which in this preſent conjuncture they had done, by ſo generouſly undervaluing all the tranſitory goods of this Life; and ſo might juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope to arrive at that pitch of Sanctity, this Contempt of the World had rais'd the Saints un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and alſo to ſhare with them the Crown of Glory, in the World to come.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Addreſſing himſelf to the Bride; he aſſur'd her, ſhe had ſtrictly follow'd the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in Solemniſing this Feaſt, by ſo cloſely following the Example of Saints; nay, even the hardeſt example, which is that of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs: Whereby ſhe had made a better, and a more moving Exhortation, by her Example, then he was able to make by his words; ſhe having verified thoſe of this great Doctor, <hi>Ser.</hi> 47. <hi>de Sactis. Ab ipſis, Martyrum Feſtivitatum gaudia
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56701:99"/>celebrantur; qui ipſorum Martyrum exempla ſequuntur; Solemnitates enim Martyrum, Exhortationes ſunt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyriorum, ut imitari non pigeat, quod celebrare delectat. The joys of the Feſtivals of Saints, are best Celebrated by thoſe, who follow their Examples; for the Solemnities of Martyrs, are ſo many Exhortatations to Martyrdome; that it may not be tedious to Practice, what is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Celebrate.</hi> Proving that the Bride had cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly enter'd upon the hardeſt of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; by taking upon her ſo long and terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a one, as was that dying Life, or living Death, ſhe had ſo joyfully embrac'd for the love of God.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>What Effects this Ceremony wrought upon her ſelf, and thoſe that were preſent at it. The great Victory she had obtain'd over her paſſions, manifeſted by her unconcernedneſs in this, and two other very moving occaſions.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>Having ended the Ceremony of her Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I hope the taking notice of ſome moving Circumſtances in it, and of the effects it wrought, both upon the Bride, and thoſe that were preſent; will prove as grateful to the Reader, as I believe the foregoing Relation has been.</p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:56701:100"/>
                  <p>The Ceremony was ſo moving, as that there was ſcarce a Religious or Secular Perſon preſent, (who were as many as the Doxal could hold) that was able to refrain from Tears; Nay, the Governor himſelf, the Marquiſs of <hi>Flavecoeur,</hi> a Perſon not at all ſubject to this paſſion; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd that he could not refrain from weeping, at the ſight of it, no more then the reſt; and that he had never felt ſuch a tenderneſs of heart in all his Life. She her ſelf, who was the Actor, was the only perſon that ſeem'd unmov'd in this action, appearing all the while with a chearful, yet ſo recollected a Countenance, as if ſhe had been totally abſorpt in God, whoſe Sacrifice ſhe fell that Day. Her little ones ſtood by her, all the time ſhe perform'd the Ceremony; which was enough to have mov'd any heart but hers. For they being of an Age, not ſenſible of their loſs, ſeem'd as little concern'd as their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and were very much pleas'd at what they underſtood not; being very buſie in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting at the Ceremony: The one put on her Veil, the other her Crown; at which Siſter <hi>Clare</hi> ſmiling, told her, in a low Voice, <hi>she wore that, for her Fathers ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Solemnity being over, one askt her how it was poſſible, that beholding the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, and Tears of ſo many about her; ſhe could remain ſo chearful and unconcern'd, as ſhe ſeem'd to be during the whole Ceremony? She Anſwer'd with a Spirit, as full of Ingenuity as Humility, <hi>That this conſtancy and chearfulneſs took their
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56701:100"/>riſe from no other ſource, than the Divine Goodneſs; which during the whole Ceremony had fil'd her heart with ſo great an Interior peace and comfort, as she had never felt before in all her Life.</hi> Which was a due reward for that generous oblation, ſhe had that Day made of her ſelf to Almighty God. Had the Perſon who askt her this Queſtion, propos'd the ſame to any one of the Religious, they would have given an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer quite different from hers, which her Humility would not permit her to give. The Religious had ſeen with how much Induſtry, even from her firſt entrance into Religion, ſhe had made it her chief endeavour to ſuppreſs and overcome, the Sallies and Efforts of Nature, and had beheld her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment in ſeveral other occaſions, and ſeen with how great a Courage, ſhe had behav'd he ſelf in other tryals, which God thought fit to ſend her during her Noviſhip, to diſpoſe her to a due per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this great act of Love; and therefore, they were not ſo ſurpriz'd, as thoſe were who had only ſeen that one action of hers, they having been Eye Witneſſes of divers eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhe had given, of her perfect and intire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to Gods Holy Will, even in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt afflictions, and moſt ſenſible tryals, that could have happen'd to her. Now the Reader that may the better perceive how ſhe carry'd her ſelf in them, I will here ſet down a Relation of her behaviour and perfect Conformity to Gods Will, at the Death of two of her deareſt friends.</p>
                  <p>The firſt tryal of her Conformity was given her by the Death of Reverend Mother <hi>Luiſa Taylor,</hi>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:56701:101"/>Abbeſs of the Monaſtry. The Hiſtory of whoſe Life deſerves a Volum, being a perſon of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and conſummated Vertue. This Holy Abbeſs being ſuddenly ſeiz'd, with violent ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of Death; was piouſly expecting her laſt happy moment, and all the Religious were ſent for, and came without the leaſt delay, except Siſter <hi>Clare;</hi> who being advertis'd by one of the Religious, that came in great haſt to her Cell, that Reverend Mother Abbeſs was a dying, and that if ſhe did not come quickly, ſhe would never ſee her alive: Siſter <hi>Clare</hi> joyning her hands, without the leaſt ſurprize, made a bow to her, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing thereby her gratitude for the Meſſage ſhe brought her (it being their Cuſtom never to ſpeak in their Cells) and without making any ſuch haſt, as might occaſion the omiſſion even of the leaſt, or moſt inconſiderable Ceremony of Religion; ſhe firſt put on her great Veil, then kiſt the ground, and afterwards with a modeſt and graceful gate, follow'd the Religious to the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, where Mother Abbeſs lay a dying; as if this ſad News had not at all come unexpected, or given her the leaſt affliction. She came into the Chamber, where her dear Friend, and tender Mother lay ready to expire, and where ſhe found all the Religious bath'd in Tears, like ſo many tender hearted Children, bemoaning the loſs of their dying Mother; yet ſhe who was like to ſuſtain as great a loſs as any (having had a great dependance upon her, and receiv'd great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from her Counſels) beheld her ready to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56701:101"/>leave her, without ſhedding a Tear, whilſt all the reſt ſeem'd to be in a very great affliction, and general conſternation; and ſo concern'd, as if all their happineſs had depended on this Abbeſſes Life. Siſter <hi>Clare</hi> knew her great Vertues and worth; and had no leſs reſpect and affection for her, than they, which the many Obligations ſhe had receiv'd from her, juſtly deſerv'd; yet for all this ſhe ſhewed not the leaſt outward ſign of grief. And when one of the Religious expreſt hers, by her many Tears for Reverend Mother Abbeſſes Death; ſhe efficaciouſly ſtopt them by the following words, <hi>VVeep not ſo much, Dear Siſter, 'tis the VVill of God, you love ſo well.</hi> Her bearing this croſs with ſo admirable a Conformity, mov'd Almighty God to reward her, by ſending another equally ſenſible; and at the ſame time, to give her his Divine Grace to bear it with no leſs conſtancy. It was the Death of her Miſtreſs of Novices, Siſter <hi>Mary Bonaventure Carleton;</hi> who thô ſhe had had a long experience in training up the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in perfection; yet, us'd to ſay, <hi>She learnt more from this, than ever she had taught the reſt; find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her perfect, even before she enter'd into the way of perfection, which made her have a very great esteem of her, confidence in her, and affection for her; looking upon her as ſent from Heaven, rather to perfect her, than be perfected by her.</hi> Siſter <hi>Clare</hi> being of a grateful nature, was no ways backward in her returns; and looking upon her as the beſt of friends, and plac'd her confidence in her as in a Mother: But God, by her ſurprizing Death, almoſt as ſoon
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56701:102"/>ſnatcht away this comfort, as he had given it; which croſs, Siſter <hi>Clare</hi> ſupported with the like courage, as ſhe did the former, even without the loſs of a Tear. Inſomuch, that being ask'd by a Perſon of Quality (Madam <hi>Flavecoeur</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors Lady of <hi>Graveling</hi>) <hi>If she were not very much concern'd for the Death of her Mistreſs?</hi> She Anſwer'd, <hi>Yes Madam, I have a great feeling of it, and indeed more than I can well expreſs.</hi> Theſe words, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of delivering them, ſtruck the Lady with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, to ſee ſuch a temper, as did not ſhed a Tear, when ſhe had thus renewed the ſorrowful thoughts of the loſs of her Miſtreſs; and mov'd her to urge the matter a little farther, and ask her, <hi>How it was poſsible, she could forbear weeping, at the Remembrance of the loſs, of ſuch a friend?</hi> The good Novice (for then ſhe was not Profeſt) told her, after her ſweet and affable way; <hi>Madam, nothing but God deſerves our Tears, who is ſo good, as to hinder me from paying them, where they are not due.</hi> Such as knew not of how excellent and ſweet a diſpoſition Siſter <hi>Clare</hi> was, might perhaps think ſo great an inſenſibility, as appear'd in ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving circumſtances as I have related, effects of an ill, hard, and ungrateful nature; which was inſenſible of kindneſs, and knew not either what friendſhip was, how to value it, what gratitude it requires, or how much a Spiritual friendſhip exceeds that of Nature, ordinarily grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sympathy, Natural inclination or Intereſt; and therefore perhaps might not much wonder at her comportment in the occaſions I have related.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56701:102"/>But thoſe who by Reading her Life, are made better acquainted with her humor, and have ſeen how ſolidly ſhe grounded her friendſhip; how warily ſhe engag'd her affection, and with what conſtancy and tenderneſs, upon all occaſions ſhe expreſt it, to thoſe ſhe had made choice of for her Friends; eſpecially, two ſuch choice Friends as theſe; whoſe great Vertue mov'd her to a high eſteem of them, their Station to a confidence in them, and their extraordinary Zeal for her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, to a grateful affection for them; cannot but wonder to ſee her in ſo ſhort a time, to have gain'd ſo ſtrange a command over her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as not to ſhed a Tear at their Death, which is the more to be admir'd in her tender Sex; eſpecially, ſince, as her Anſwer to the Governors Lady declares, ſhe ſo ſenſibly felt this Tryal. But God by her faithful co-operation with his Grace, had ſo ſtrengthen'd her to overcome theſe feelings of Nature, as not to give the leaſt ſign or expreſſion of ſorrow; whereby, ſhe manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that thô ſhe lov'd them well, yet ſhe lov'd God better; whom alſo ſhe lov'd in ſuch a manner, as to deſire rather, that he ſhould pleaſe himſelf than her; nay, that even he ſhould pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in her affliction. Which ſhew'd, not only her ſincere love to God, but alſo her diſ-intereſſed love to her friends, prefering their happineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her own; and therefore ſince their Death was a gain to them, ſhe could not regret her own loſs by it, nor permit her ſorrow, to overcome the joy ſhe ought to have, in thinking they were
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56701:103"/>happy. The will of God was what ſhe endeavor'd moſt induſtriouſly to find out; and joyfully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd in whatſoever terrifying manner it appear'd to her; as her words to that Pious Religious, who was lamenting the Abbeſſes Death declares. And therefore, what tryal ſoever of her Love, God thought fit to ſend her, by depriving her of thoſe friends ſhe lov'd beſt; ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd this tryal ſhould not deprive her of the chief object of her Love, himſelf; who was the beſt of friends: And therefore was reſolv'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her love in the beſt manner ſhe was able, by preferring his Will and Pleaſure, before her own in all things. Whereby ſhe ſo ſurmounted all theſe ſenſible tryals, as to ſeem even inſenſible of them: And alſo diſpos'd her ſelf for the making her Profeſſion, and for the loſs of two ſuch friends, with ſuch a conſtancy and unconcernedneſs, as I have declar'd: And was alſo inabl'd quite to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the tenderneſs of an affectionate Mother towards her Children; as in the following Chapter I ſhall relate.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>Her exact compliance with Mother Abbeſſes Orders, in taking care of her Children, in which she expreſt more of a careful Mistreſs, than a tender Mother; and hereby manifested, that Pure Obedience, the inclination of Grace; and not affection to her Children, the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature; mov'd her to accept this employment.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AFter ſhe had made her Profeſſion, as above declar'd; the firſt thing ſhe ſet upon, was ſtrictly to perform, what ſhe had ſo lately promis'd. Obedience was her chief care, and thô nothing was more contrary to her inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than to look after her Children; yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this charge was impos'd upon her, by her Superior, ſhe chearfully undertook it. She knew by experience, what advantages, order and method always brought with it; and therefore was ſollicitous, that every moment ſhould be rightly ſpent by her Children. For this end, ſhe made them an exact Diſtribution, or Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, for every hour of the Day, accommodated to their Age and Years. She ſpar'd no labor to Cultivate theſe tender Plants, and even from their
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56701:104"/>Infancy, to prepare them for the Garden of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if God ſhould make them ſo happy, as to call them to that bleſſed State. To ſet down the whole Diſtribution of time ſhe had made for them, would I fear ſeem too tedious; yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but let the Reader ſee ſome part of it, and thereby give him a knowledge of her own Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhe without doubt practiſing her ſelf, what ſhe endeavor'd to inſtil into them. She order'd them that the firſt thing they did as ſoon as they awak'd, ſhould be to make the Sign of the Croſs, adding the following words, <hi>Bleſſed be the Holy and undivided Trinity, now and for ever. Amen.</hi> And having done this, ſhe bids them tell ſweet Jeſus, that they would ſuffer the Mortification of riſing in the cold, and of leaving the comfort of their warm bed, for his ſake, who left Heaven for theirs. Then, as ſoon as they were up, ſhe Counſels them to kiſs the ground, in Memory of that duſt, out of which they came, and to which they were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and to make an Act of Adoration, and Thankſgiving to the Divine Majeſty, for having Created them of nothing, capable of lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſerving and enjoying him for all Eternity; and alſo for having preſerv'd them the Night paſt from all dangers. Then that they ſhould make an Oblation of themſelves to his Infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Afterwards to ſay an <hi>Ave Mary</hi> to beg our Ladies bleſſing upon them for that Day; whom they were to love and confide in, as in a Mother; having recourſe to her in all their neceſſities as ſuch, and dayly beg her Interceſſion, by ſaying
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56701:104"/>their Beads together, at the time ſhe had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Then ſhe order'd them to ſay a <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> &amp;c. in thankſgiving to God, for the glory given to their good Angels, and for the honor given to themſelves, by beſtowing upon them ſuch Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and Powerful Protectors; whoſe Protection that Day, they were humbly to beg; and then to recommend themſelves to their particular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons and Saints of their Name, and Pray for their friends; eſpecially; for their Grand-fathers and Uncles Converſion.</p>
                  <p>This done, ſhe order'd them before they came to School to her, to go to their Cloſſet, and there offer up that, and all the other actions of that Day, with a pure intention (for want of which many even of our beſt actions were frequently loſt, and the Merit alſo of our other actions, which are indifferent, and of no Merit without ſuch an intention) that as ſoon as they came thither they ſhould ſtrive which of them ſhould firſt kiſs ſweet Jeſus's Feet in their Crucifix, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber they had choſen St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> for one of their Patroneſſes, whoſe place was at the foot of the Croſs, when Chriſt dy'd upon it; and wiſh to Love him as ſhe did, ſaying a <hi>Pater</hi> and <hi>Ave,</hi> and telling our dear Savior they were going to School to pleaſe him, and that all their actions that Day ſhall be for no other end.</p>
                  <p>When they came to School, to confirm them in the practice of that profitable Devotion to their good Angel, ſhe had recommended to them, ſhe gave them an example of it her ſelf; and took out
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56701:105"/>of her breaſt a little Paper Picture of her good Angel, ſhe always carry'd about her, and placeing it before her, and them (to put them in mind of their good Angels who were preſent, thô inviſible) ſhe recommended her ſelf and Children to them. To theſe ſhe added, alſo other profitable Documents, and neceſſary Inſtructions; as of ſubmiſſion, of obedience, but moſt particularly of that of Humility; a Virtue very neceſſary to be acquir'd in young Years, where Nature ſtill leads to the contrary. For this end, ſhe would have them always, call their Maid Siſter, in which ſhe ſhow'd no little ſign of Humility in her ſelf, by commanding them to give the ſame Title to their Servant, they gave to her ſelf: And thô nothing could be more taking, than the ſweet and ſubmiſſive humor or theſe Children towards her; yet ſhe forc'd the efforts of Nature, always to give place to thoſe of Grace; as may be gather'd from the following paſſage.</p>
                  <p>The Governours Lady, being one Day within the Incloſure amongſt the Religious, deſir'd to ſee Siſter <hi>Clare,</hi> and her Children together; upon this, ſhe was order'd to come, and as ſhe enter'd the Room, the Lady wiſper'd one of them in the Ear, from whom I had the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſaying, <hi>I ſee, 'tis not a poor and mean Habit, that can hide true Mobility and VVorth;</hi> and beholding her very attentively, ſhe was ſo ſtruck, that words were too ſcant to expreſs the ſentiments of her mind; till ſome Tears had made way for them,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56701:105"/>and then recovering her ſelf, in a paſſionate and abrupt manner, ſhe ſaid; <hi>Here needs a Powerful Hand, to ſuſtain this great work;</hi> and being ſtill in a kind of confuſion, ſhe could not proceed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, upon that ſubject, but looking ſtedfaſtly upon the Children (who all this time, by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Language Careſs'd their Mother, and hung about her Neck) ſhe broke out again into this expreſſion. <hi>O Madam, how is it poſsible, to leave ſuch Children? This is a touch of God, that ſtrangely ſurprizes me.</hi> Another Perſon of Quality that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd the Governors Lady, ſeeing their Mother expreſs ſo little kindneſs and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards them, endeavor'd to Careſs them, and ſhow as much fondneſs towards them as ſhe was able. Telling them, <hi>They did miſtake their Mother, and that she her ſelf was their Mother, and not Siſter</hi> Clare; upon which the Children ran from her to their Mother, hanging about her, and ſpeaking to her in ſuch moving Language, as melted the Ladys heart; and mov'd her with Tears, modeſtly to inveigh againſt the leaving ſuch little Angels; declaring, <hi>That her change of Condition, was an act above her Sex; nay, even above Flesh and Blood, and was in her opinion, rather to be admir'd then imitated.</hi> This Rhetoric of both theſe Ladies had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon Siſter <hi>Clare;</hi> ſhe ſeem'd as if their words had not concern'd her, or as if ſhe had not heard them; and by this her humble and modeſt comportment, much amaz'd the ſtanders by; who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd to ſee God Almighties Grace ſo ſtrangely Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing over the bent, and inclination, or Nature.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Her Zeal for the Converſion of her Relations to the Catholic Faith, her Prayer for them, and Ferverous Letters to her Father, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her paſſionate Love towards him, by her fervent Zeal for his Converſion, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his great ſeverity, and unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes towards her.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BUt this Heroical abnegation, of whatſoever the tenderneſs of Nature was able to ſuggeſt, thô very extraordinary, as we have ſeen in the foregoing Chapter, did no ways hinder that reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Zeal, ſhe always had for the Converſion of her friends. Her own words, ſufficiently prove that her Charity had no other tendency; as the following Prayer ſhe made for her nigheſt Relations will evidence: Which I find in her own hand amongſt the reſt of her Papers.</p>
                  <p>O <hi>Most great God of Mercy, look with the Eyes of compaſſion upon my near Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Friends, who are yet detain'd in Schiſm and Hereſie. And remember I beſeech you, that you did not bring them out of their Eternal Nothing, and Stamp upon their Souls
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56701:106"/>your own Sacred Image, in order to destroy, and abandon thoſe perfect products of your powerful hand, having been pleas'd to ſend your only Son, to pay the ranſome for them, as well as for my unworthy ſelf, with the price of your most precious Blood. Dart therefore, O most merciful God, ſome beams of your light into their dark, and deceived underſtandings: Have mercy upon them, and let the light of your Countenance shine upon them, that they may ſee the Truth of your Sacred Mysteries: Give them Grace to ſubmit their Necks to the ſweet and eaſie Yoke of your Precepts, propos'd, and deliver'd by your Holy Church. O my dear Redeemer, what have I done for you? Or what have I deſerv'd at your hands, that I should be called to your ſaving Faith, and be made a member of your Holy Church. Impart</hi> I <hi>beſeech you, the like favor, by your bitter Death and Paſſion, to thoſe your miſled, and unbelieving Creatures my Friends and Relations; that together with my ſelf they may faithfully acknowledge, adore, and love you, their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Creator and Redeemer, here in this World, and in the World to come, praiſe and magnifie your goodneſs, and joyfully Celebrate your Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies with Canticles of Eternal Gratitude, and Thanksgiving.</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:56701:107"/>
                  <p>If this Zeal was ſo particular for her friends, you may imagine how active it was for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of her Father; whom ſhe ſo paſſionately lov'd, that no want of Affection in him, was ever able to leſſen it: Who, thô he Wrote ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Letters to her; yet he never gave her the Title of Child, or Subſcrib'd himſelf, her Father. But oftentimes in his Letters, he upbraids her, for committing an unheard of ingratitude, in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a courſe as this was, without asking his advice or conſent: The news of which (as he ſaid in one) ſeem'd to him incredible, becauſe he never judg'd, that her Husband's or her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to one another, had been ſo moderate (by any thing he had ever heard or ſeen,) as that they could be perſwaded upon pretence of Chriſtianity, to embrace ſuch a ſtrange and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid undertaking, by breaking the Solemn Vow of Matrimony. That hereby, ſhe ſeem'd to have ſuckt the Milk of a Tygreſs, rather than of a Woman; and to have loſt all good Nature, and even Humanity it ſelf. He added, that it was an injury done to Heaven, to call ſuch follies, and Inſinuations as theſe Inſpirations, and godly motions; aſſuring her upon his Faith, that all the Catholics he had ſpoken with, condemned this raſh and inconſiderate Action of theirs; and therefore conjur'd her, either to return to <hi>England,</hi> that he might have the comfort of viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them there; or to live together ſome where in <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Flanders;</hi> whether he would come to ſee them: Requiring her to obey this his advice,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56701:107"/>as the Counſel of a Father: Which if ſhe did not, he would never give her his bleſſing; and ends his Letter by a bare ſubſcription of his Name. Theſe ſevere checks from a Father, ſhe lov'd ſo tenderly, muſt needs have wrought upon her, had not the Grace of Almighty God in a particular manner aſſiſted her, ſo piouſly to bear them; and that ſhe did ſo, is evident, from the Dutiful Anſwer ſhe return'd him, to his Letter couch't in ſo hard and ſevere terms.</p>

Wherefore <hi>I</hi> moſt humbly beg you upon my Knees, to give me leave to offer unto you, the ſole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of our ſo much wonder'd at reſolutions. You know Sir, that the State of Life <hi>I</hi> am now in, is but what God Almighty has been pleas'd to grant me, after a long and earnest purſuit of it; and which if it had pleas'd him to move

                        <p>MY Obligations, and ardent affection for you, will not ſuffer me to be long ſilent, nor to fear, or excuſe my often troubling you; and <hi>I</hi> do now do it, in hopes that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and acquaintance of this Gentleman (who is the bearer) will be ſo welcome to you; that you will esteem his Company a divertiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56701:109"/>At least Sir, grant me this only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt and ſatisfaction, to hear you have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed with him. I do really aſſure my ſelf that if you were convinced of the neceſsity, and had weighed the many reaſons why you ought to be other than what you are; your heart is too great and Noble, to be kept back by any Worldly conſideration. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> had ſurely ſomething extraordinary in his Soul, before it me with it's right Object; and give me leave to ſay Sir, ſo have you; and I hope you may live to teach many to Love as he did; if once all hindrances were taken away betwixt you and that raviſhing goodneſs of God. What is it we ſeek after, but full contentment of mind? And who can give that, but the plenitude of all goodneſs? In him there is nothing but love and joy, his nature is to make all things happy in him, and whoever has once experienced, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights he gives proper for the Soul, will immediately abhor thoſe of Senſe, and confeſs them to be real pains. Sir, what can you leave, or ſuffer, but he can fortifie you to undergo; and change into comfort, what by nature you most of all fear? And infallibly his goodneſs will do ſo, if you will only hear and Diſcourſe impartially: Which on my Knees I humbly beg for Christ's ſake, in remembrance of all he ſuffer'd for you. Sir, do not deny me; behold me at your Feet
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56701:110"/>embracing them, with the affection of my whole heart, and be no longer cruel to your ſelf, who are ſo dear to me; ſince all the joys in this World can be nothing to me, without your being happy. Pardon me this importunity: I could Write, I confeſs, and never give over, but for fear of troubling you, being truly, thô your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, yet</p>

And thô neither this, nor thoſe dayly Prayers and Tears ſhe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd for him, could gain the leaſt upon him; yet ſtill ſhe continu'd her ſollicitations to Heaven in his behalf, and that her Prayers might be the more efficacious, ſhe endeavour'd the more earneſtly to obtain a more perfect and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Union with God.</p>

                  <p>O Most Sacred and undivided Trinity, Three Perſons, and one Eſſence, caſt a glance of your All-ſeeing Eye, upon my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, wretched and wounded Soul, groaning under the burthen of her own Abyſs of miſery; trembling at the conſideration of your ſecret judgments; confounded at the memory of her former diſloyalties, and ingratitude, all cover'd with ſhame, and pieret with ſorrow: Humbly proſtrating her ſelf before the Throne of your dreadful Majesty; and tendering her Petition to your infinite Mercy. You have been pleas'd
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56701:111"/>O benign Lover of all Souls, to expect her hitherto most patiently. You have most effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly terrifyed her with your threats; you have moſt earneſtly invited her, and powerfully drawn her with your promiſes; you have given her a ſtrong confidence in your goodneſs, and mercy. You have induced her to an abſolute expiation of her Crimes, and a perfect reconciliation by a ſincere Contrition, intire Sacramental Confeſsion, and prompt ſatisfaction; you have given her strong reſolutions of an intire Reformation. This is the change of your right-hand, and the only effect of your goodneſs, to whom be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed all honor and praiſe. And now my power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creator, my unfetter'd Soul, aſpires to a high flight, ſhe covets a nearer conjunction with your infinite perfections, and excellencies, the only Object of her Love, and repoſe of her deſires. O! who will give her the wings of a Dove, that ſhe may Soar up to her beloved, and ſpend the rest of this Pilgrimage, in the ſweet Contemplation of Heavenly Mysteries, by a perpetual retirement, and divorce from thoſe many turbulent diſtractions, ſhe has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber'd withal; and from all ſollicitude and care of any thing below. Infuſe therefore, O Divine attractor of Souls, your efficacious Grace; strengthen her deſires, and confirm her reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in ſo high an interprize; for the Reliques
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56701:111"/>of ſin have yet an overſwaying Power, over her feeble Will, her cruel Enemies lye in wait to obstruct her free paſſage into this happy State of repoſe. The ſenſual propenſions of Fleſh and Blood, are in a continual conflict to ſubdue reaſon, and the enticing allurements of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly objects in her imagination, endeavour to blind the interior Eyes of her Soul; and divert her from beholding the beauty of Vertue, from conſidering her own miſery and ingratitude, and from contemplating your infinite beauty, and love towards her. Let therefore, your Powerful strength break afunder, all theſe strong bonds of Iniquity, and let the ſame force that has ſo happily diſpoſſest Satan, of the Empire he had in her, re-invest you in your juſt inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and habitation. Embelish her with all ſolid Vertues and Perfections; make her a Paradiſe of delights, by leting her behold you in all things; and then re-aſſume her to your ſelf, who are her Creator, Preſerver, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Having gather'd out of her own Memoires, how far ſhe was advanced in all the ways of an interior Life, and to what a pitch of the Union of God, ſhe was arriv'd; it follows that we take notice of thoſe ſteps by which ſhe mounted up to this ſo eminent degree of Perfection: Which her Ghoſtly Father, and ſeveral of the Religious
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56701:112"/>take notice of in the Characters, they by requeſt gave of her ſince her Death, from her firſt entrance into a Religious State of Life:</hi> Viz. <hi>that ſhe had ſo deep an apprehenſion of her own No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs, that of all Vices ſhe ſeem'd to fear, that of vain-glory the leaſt. All the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary favors ſhe receiv'd from Heaven, ſerv'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to increaſe the bad Opinion ſhe had conceiv'd of her ſelf. From this Humility, and profound acknowledgment of her own unworthineſs, ſprung as from their ſource all thoſe other Vertues ſo ſingular in her. As to her Recollection, beſides what I have already ſaid of this ſubject, ſhe trod the paths of the moſt Illuſtrious Saints, always walking in the ſight of God; which holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe became ſo habitual to her, that ſhe once ingeniouſly acknowleged,</hi> That ſince her entrance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Poor <hi>Clares,</hi> she had but twice loſt the Divine Preſence, and that for about the ſpace of an <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> each time, being taken up with too great ſollicitude for her Children. <hi>No wonder then, ſhe had as many unqueſtionable Witneſſes of a Recollected Spirit, as there were perſons who dayly convers'd with her. Her looks, as they ſaid, and that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Air which appear'd in her Countenance, was ſufficient to ſtrike Reverence and Devotion into the moſt wandring and diſſipated imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There was no need of ſtudying her humor, or obſerving her times; her temper was always e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, as was her mind; thoſe Graces and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of an even and pleaſant humor, never fail'd her; ſo that no accident, thô never ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56701:112"/>prizing and ſtrange, could make the leaſt viſible impreſſion upon her: Her Vertue was not of a faint or fading Nature, like that of ſome tender Conſtitutions, which changeth with every blaſt, but ſtrong and permanent; not to be alter'd by any viciſſitudes, or various events of this Life: The change of weather, the infirmity of ſickneſs, the Death of friends, had no influence upon her conſtancy; this golden vein of indifferency that ran through the whole body of her actions, made her Superior to all events, that are wont to move, and work upon others; nothing but what was in God, from God, and for God, was any part of her care; in a word, not to run this Topic out into a Volum; ſhe had obtain'd by a Maſtery over her natural inclinations and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſo perfect an union with Almighty God, that her whole Life ſeem'd to be one continu'd Act of love and Adoration. This Communication with God, was attended with that high degree of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which according to Divines conſiſts in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively receiving the impreſſions of the Divine Spirit; inſomuch, that her firſt Abbeſs Reverend Mother</hi> Taylor, <hi>who had ſpent ſeveral Years in that Holy practice, affirm'd,</hi> That it was ſo ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and ſublime, that all she had either read or heard upon that ſubject, came short of her Prayer, which thô she could never conceive or underſtand the depth of; yet she was fully convinced it was from God; as having ſo irrefragable a Teſtimony againſt Deluſion, as was her humble Obedience and ſubmiſsion to her Ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers; in laying it aſide as long as they judged ſit;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56701:113"/>
                     <hi>thô in the mean time ſhe felt ſo great deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, dryneſs and darkneſs, as she was better able to ſuffer then to expreſs; which was a ſecond proof and no leſs convincing than the former, of the Truth and Goodneſs of her Prayer, and of the Spirit that conducted her in it.</hi>

For let the Prayer be never ſo high, and never ſo hard to be underſtood, the fruits thereof are viſible, and eaſily perceiv'd. Her Prayer then, thô it was very high, did not conſiſt in extravagant Raptures and Tranſports, which ſometimes draw to ſelf eſteem, ſtifneſs of judgment, a neglect of Rule and Order; but in the practice of all ſolid Vertues: As ſhe her ſelf hath given us to underſtand by tranſmitting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us thoſe Divine lights, and interior motions Almighty God infus'd into her Soul, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us ſo many convincing arguments, of the

                        <q>How long, O moſt pure Object of Divine Love, ſhall I be deprived of that Soveraign good, which my Soul inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly thirſts after? When will you put a period to this my tedious baniſhment? When ſhall I be ſatiated with the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your glorious aſpect? I am wholy tranſported with the love of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable goodneſs, and my ardent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ſurpaſs the bounds of moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But the conſideration of the Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Viſion, and my own unworthineſs gives me a ſevere check, and puts me in mind of my own aſpiring preſumption; telling me, that if my wandring thoughts ſoar ſo high, as to pretend to the favors of boſom friends; the heavy burden of my Inquities and Tranſgreſſions, will bring me to an unſeaſonable fall. O diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Conſideration! O horrid deſolation! This is the Dart that deeply pierces my poor Soul. This is that fierce and cruel Lyon, which with open Jaws ſeems
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56701:114"/>ready to devour me, and rend in pieces my bleeding heart; whether then ſhall I turn my ſelf, but to you, O my God the fountain of mercy, and goodneſs? Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor this diſtreſſed Soul of mine, which you have framed according to your own likeneſs. But how can I hope for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from you, my Powerful Creator? Whoſe Divine Perfections I have ſo often contemned; whoſe Sacred Law I have ſo frequently violated; whoſe Holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations I have ſo much rejected; whoſe amiable Invitations I have moſt ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſlighted, and wholy defaced the Sacred Image of your Divinity, which you imprinted on my Soul; nor can I alledge any Merits of my own, that may make me worthy of your favor or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but like a helpleſs wretch, my own Conſcience crys out guilty, and fills me with ſhame and confuſion before the Tribunal of your Sacred Majeſty. What hopes then of redreſs? What Advocate to plead my cauſe? Shall the Sins of my Life paſt ſeperate me from what is ſo dear to me? O Eternal Sun of Glory, let the peircing beams of your bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs diſſipate the dark Clouds of my Tranſgreſſions; and open the way for an
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56701:114"/>Interview, between me and you, the only comfort of my Soul. Let the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fire of your Charity diſſolve what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is hard and frozen in me; inflame my heart with an intenſe love for your Beauty and excellency; let not Heaven frown upon me, for therein lies all the Treaſure I hope for.</q>

                        <p>DEar Sister in Ieſus Chriſt, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of darkneſs all is darkneſs. The light is reſer'd for Heaven, which God hides from us in this World under Shadows, Viſions and Figures, which St. <hi>Dennis</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> admir'd. and reverenc'd, without underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. Whilſt <hi>Adam</hi> acted by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Faith, he conſerved himſelf in the State of Innocency, and Immortality, and in a perfect Vnion with God; but from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he endeavour'd to raiſe himſelf to the light of knowledge, he loſt himſelf in it's dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and became Criminal; becauſe he deſir'd a greater knowledge, than God had beſtowed upon him.</p>

                        <p>So commonly the greatest Schollars, and most piercing Wits, do not make the humblest and greateſt Saints. Learning is a Tyrant, that never failes to perſecute them that poſſeſs it. It perverts their Wills, caſts them into Pride, and preſumption, and now and then into the Abyſs of Hereſie and Apoſtacy. Hence it is, that God has founded the Maxims of Faith, upon his word; whoſe chief Mysteries, and moſt neceſſary to Salvation, are incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; that he might make the way to Heaven, equally eaſie to the Learned, and ignorant, to great and ſmall; and ſo hold our Iudgments in a perfect Vnion, with all he ſhould propoſe by his Church. Moreover, in this blind Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, one may testifie a greater fidelity, and practice more Vertue; there being leſs of ſelf love and ſatisfaction, and more courage and generoſity, in an humble acknowledgment of our ignorance (ſuch as St. <hi>Paul</hi> made when he ſaid, <hi>He knew nothing but Chriſt Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,</hi> and that he had no other knowledge, than what he had learnt at the foot of the Croſs) than by being Maſter of a greater knowledge, than the greateſt Doctors of the Church were inſpir'd with. Wherefore Dear Sister, study fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity more than knowledge, value Faith more than Life, and Love, more than curioſity; which Love operates in you the Vnion you deſire,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56701:117"/>and has made you like <hi>Abraham</hi> leave your Houſe, your Country, and even thoſe tender and Sacred Friendſhips, which were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted you to enjoy in the World: To the end that this Vnion might be ſo much the ſtronger and more pure, and that God might have an intire poſſeſsion of your heart, which he before poſſeſſed but by halves.</p>
                        <p>Dear Sister, this abſolute leaving all you poſſest, by your Profeſsion in the face of the Church; this generous ſubmitting your ſelf, for time and Eternity, to the diſpoſal of the Divine Providence; this blind Obedience, to the Voice of your Spouſe, whom you have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd; does not only unite you to him, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you to a perfect annihilation of your ſelf; by which one comes to a kind of Deiformity, which is the Kingdom of God in a Soul; when abandoning her own knowledge, lights, deſires, and will; she plunges her ſelf with all the effects both of her natural and ſupernatural Being, into him; that henceforth ſhe may ſay with St. <hi>Paul, Vivo ego, jam non ego, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit verò in me Chriſtus; I live, now 'tis not I that live, but Chriſt that lives in me;</hi> all her works, being in a manner Gods operations.</p>
                        <pb n="213" facs="tcp:56701:117"/>
                        <p>'Tis then (when a Soul is arriv'd to this place) that God is her Life, her Being, her Light, and her Love; 'tis then that he works in her all things, she neither knowing the end, nor cauſe of them. And this shews the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, of not looſing God a moment, without a continual remembrance of him, or an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of his preſence; he who has his heart and eyes continually upon you, as if you were the Object of his happineſs, cannot looſe you for an instant; you have therefore nothing to looſe; becauſe he is your All; and you cannot looſe any thing becauſe you poſſeſs him, who is all things; and becauſe you have left off what you were in appearance, and in your own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that he alone might raign and triumph in you, and be All in All to you. Beſides a Soul in Grace, can neither forget, nor looſe God for one ſingle moment; as well according to nature (her Memory and Will being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible part of her ſelf, and without parts) as according to God who is her Treaſure, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of her Memory, and the Will of her Will; which Powers being united to, and lost in God, have no more any Being or Action of their own; all their operations, Exterior and Interior being from God and in God; ſo that loſs or gain, forgetting or remembring, must be the ſame to you; for if the actual and perceptible, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56701:118"/>which paſſes by the ſenſe and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, were profitable for you; he loves you too well, to ſubstract it from you for a moment. It is not therefore this exterior Image, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to ſenſe, that you ought to stop at, but rather at that Interior and Eternal Memory, which reſides in the bottom of your Soul, and is continually in Action, becauſe the Principle of Life is in it, and that is even the Life which makes it live; for in the State of it's Vnion with the Body, if cannot raiſe it ſelf above what it ſees and knows, without the help of ſome Figure, or Corporal Character; or at least ſome shadow of matter, which vanishes away by Faith, as all other material, tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or corruptible things do. Your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection therefore dear Sister conſiſts in being what you are, and doing, what you do, and in nothing elſe; if God looked for more be would more hearken after your deſires, than his own; Holy indifferency in a State of Life or Vocation, is that which makes up every ones Perfection, and Sanctification; for to deſire to be more than he has a mind we ſhould be; to gape after more, than he has a mind to give; not to be content, with ones Portion; to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to looſe him a moment, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires and hides himſelf from us on purpoſe, to diſ-unite us from all things whatever, except
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56701:118"/>from his Holy Will; is an effect of ſelf-love, which inſtead of uniting us more and more to him; doth rather ſeparate and divide us from him.</p>

How many Prayers, Works of Charity, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions, Watchings, Labors, Mortifications and Fasts, will one Day crave Iuſtice againſt us? For having done them by the Spirit of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to pleaſe our ſelves; and rather follow'd our own fancy and opinion, than the Will of God: Which by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah 58.3.</hi> he complaines of: He only requires from us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to what he gives us, and is ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with our doing his Will with a Purity of Intention, rather than our own; who Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies even our defects, in that ſingle Relation, they bear to his Orders, and Eternal deſigns; it is this which made St. <hi>Paul</hi> as well as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſay, <hi>He did the evil he would not, and did not the good he would;</hi> at which he was not at all troubled, knowing well that God does not impute to ſin, the failings
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56701:119"/>of nature, which are not free; ſince love excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them, covers them, blots them out, and even turns them to our good, and glory. So that if you deſire to profit by your own loſſes, to buy Heaven with bad Mony (and indeed we have no other) make a Divine Commerce, an Eternal Bargain with God; whereby your Will, which is a free, Spiritual; and an Immortal Power, Mistreſs of her ſelf, and of all the other Powers, does from this moment for ever deſtine, imploy, and apply, all the parts and peices of your Being, to be (as the hand of a Dial that ſhows the hour) a perpetual Remembrance, Congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Thankſgiving and Iubilation for all the Praiſes, Homages, Reſpects and Adorations, which all Creatures give, or ſhall eternally give to God, for the love he bears to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; to the end you may Adore, and Glorifie him in this Spirit; and love him with that eternal love, which alone is worthy of him: And God will ſhew you as much good will, and give you as great a reward for it, as if you your ſelf did give all the Offerings, Sacrifices, and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, which Men and Angels give him in Heaven and Earth. Nay, the Will, that has an Infinity for it's Object, may make all the Individuals, of Human , and Angelical Natures; all the motions of Soul, and Body; Nay even all Created Beings, to an Atome
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56701:119"/>or grain of Sand; concur to ſo noble a work.</p>
                        <p>Good God how admirable, profitable, and Divine is this exerciſe! which coſts nothing at all, and may be compleated in a moment? And what Treaſures of Glory does a Man looſe, that is either ignorant of it, or neglects it? Whilſt he is buſied in ſo many things, whilst he is ſad or joyful, upon account of different accidents; without referring them to God, as their Origin: Since in him they are eternal, infinite, and moſt perfect, and out of him they are nothing but vanity and lys; that is finite, corruptible, and ſubject to an infinity of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Dear Siſter, stop a while here, view this Spirit of Vnity, which is the Spirit of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which gathers divided and diſ-united things into one, to draw us out of multiplicity and the imperfection of nature, into this holy Vnion, with a Transformation into himſelf: Which makes one contrary to be found in the other, the Creature in God, Perfection in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, Vnity in Multiplicity, Light in Darkneſs, Peace in War, Recollection in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction, Sweetneſs in the Croſs, Abundance in Poverty, Life in Death, Corporal in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, God in All, and All in Him. Do not miſtake me I beſeech you, in thinking that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God changes ſo often his manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56701:120"/>with you, he is not ſtill yours, and you his; dive by the light of Faith, into the darkneſs where he hides himſelf penetrate the Veiles of Bodies and Spirits, with which he covers himſelf; ſee him act in all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, giving them their determinate motion, who is properly their Life and Being: Not a Hair preſents it ſelf unto our Eyes, without his ſight and permiſsion; to the end, that that lively and active Faith of yours, may ſee him in his Images, and Characters; as we ſee a Saint in his Cloaths, or a Friend in Imagination; whilst we behold his Picture, that repairs the weakneſs of our Memory.</p>
                        <p>Dear Sister, make the laſt effort, imitate a King, who to Establiſh himſelf, and to Reign peaceably in a Kingdom newly Conquer'd; fills every place with horror and deſolation: Puts to the Sword, not only ſuch as oppoſe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, but even rids himſelf of his ſuſpected Friends, for fear of ſome Treaſonable ſurprize. In like manner do you kill and destroy all your Sworn Enemies, Annihilate all your deſires, and Paſsions, take leave even of what appears Vertue and Perfection; becauſe they make a noiſe and pudder, and cauſe more Smoak and distractti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than they augment the fire of Love: Bid Love enter into it's ſource, cauſe Humility to keep love Company, or debaſe it ſelf below Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;

                  <p>His Son the chief hopes of his Family, being now grown up in Years, and having had an Education ſuitable to his Birth and Quality, Mr. <hi>Ruiſſon</hi> deſign'd preſently to Marry him, that he might ſee him happily ſettl'd in the World, before he left it; and therefore made it his buſineſs to find out a Match that was convenient for him. But whilſt the good Father was thus contriving to ſettle his Son in the World, his Heavenly Father called him out of it, not immediately to himſelf, but to a Religious Life, the beſt and next way to him; for his Son finding himſelf inſpir'd by God, to enter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Diſcalc't <hi>Carmelites,</hi> was fearful of propoſing it to his Father (knowing his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns look't another way, and believing it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to gain his conſent) and choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther firſt to enter into Religion, and then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his Father with it: Which he did preſently after in a very Dutiful Letter, aſſuring him that the too great affection he bore him, made him not diſcover his Inclinations to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, apprehending on the one ſide leaſt his compaſſion, in being a Spectator of his Fathers afflictions, might be ſo great, as even to make him ſtagger in his Vocation; and on the other, fearing he ſhould be wanting in his gratitude to God, for having given him ſo gratious a Call to the moſt happy State of a Religious Life; if he did not firſt embrace the happineſs God call'd him to, before he acquainted his Father, with his deſign: Wherefore he beg'd his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56701:123"/>for ſo bold an attempt; for he hop't his prefering what he thought Gods Will, before his, would not appear a Crime; and that it might not, he deſir'd him rather to Attribute his not asking his advice, to the diffidence he had in his own ſtrength, to reſiſt his kind and powerful perſwaſions; than to a want of due confidence in him; aſſuring him, that in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, he ſhould make it his utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to contribute to his greater comfort and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and thereby expreſs his due Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his laſt breath.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Ruiſſon</hi> was indeed, as his Son expected, much ſurpriz'd at this Letter, but 'twas with a joyful, not ſorrowful ſurprizal; for contrary to his Son's apprehenſion, he congratulates with him for his happy choice, by which he had rais'd his felicity above whatever he could have hop't to compaſs for him in this World, ſhould he have been able to have left him the Univerſe. And as for what concern'd his, and his Families advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Match he had in proſpect for him; he look't upon it as unworthy of his thoughts, in compariſon of the comfort he took, in ſeeing him ſo: happy by the choice he had made: Aſſuring him, he ſhould be better pleas'd to have his Family end this way, than to leave him Maſter of it: Becauſe by his quitting theſe tranſitory goods, he had put-himſelf into a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure way of gaining, not only a Hundred-fold in this life, according to our Saviours promiſe to thoſe <hi>that quit Father or Mother, Houſe or Lands,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56701:124"/>
                     <hi>for his ſake; but an Everlaſting Inheritance, and an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal felicity in the next.</hi> And therefore, he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Congratulated, and envy'd his Pious under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, than diſ-approv'd or repin'd at it. And in a Letter to Brother <hi>Clare</hi> not long after this had happen'd, he Writes as follows. <hi>VVhilſt my thoughts were taken up about Marrying my Son, behold a wonderful effect of Providence, a change wrought by the powerful hand of the higheſt, more pleaſing to me than the gaining an Empire: He without acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me, or any of his friends with his deſign, is enter'd to be Religious amongſt the</hi> Carmelites: <hi>Expreſsing hereby ſuch a contempt of the VVorld, as it truly deſerves. VVherefore, pardon me if I have recourſe to yours, as I have to the reſt of my friends Prayers; that the mercy of God would vouchſafe to cherish that Seed of his Grace, he has caſt into his Heart; and not permit my unworthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be any impediment to the continuance of his mercy towards him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not long after, his Houſe at <hi>Herke,</hi> near <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi> was caſually ſet on Fire, and happening in the Night, 'twas ſo late diſcover'd, that all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours they could uſe, towards the quenching of it, prov'd in-effectual; nor were they able to ſave any thing conſiderable of his Goods: He was all the time as buſie as any one, in his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, both to ſuppreſs the Fire, and ſecure what he could of his Goods; but when he found the Fire had got the upper hand, and all his endeavours were in vain, he went and warmed himſelf (it being Winter time) with as much unconcernedneſs, tranquillity, and chearfulneſs of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56701:124"/>mind (which viſibly appear'd in his Countenance) as if it had been a Bone-fire; which one of his Neighbors took great notice of, and extreamly wondering at this his extraordinary comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, asked him how it was poſſible to ſuffer ſo great a Croſs, with ſo much calmneſs and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, as he expreſt by his looks? To which he Anſwer'd, <hi>That he looked upon what had happen'd to be the VVill of God, who had abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed his loſs, by giving him a greater comfort and ſatisfaction, in ſeeing his bleſſed VVill perform'd in this manner, than he could have receiv'd, had he beſtow'd upon him an infinity of Earthly Treaſures, and Temporal Bleſsings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another very remarkable thing of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is, that the day before his Death, Brother <hi>Clare</hi> going to <hi>Montague,</hi> took his way by <hi>Herke,</hi> to have the ſatisfaction of giving Mr. <hi>Ruiſſon</hi> a Viſit (who had been ſo kind as to give him many at <hi>Liege,</hi> upon the account of that Spiritual Friendſhip, which he had contracted with Siſter <hi>Clare</hi>) coming thither, he found him very ſick; yet perfectly in his Senſes, and as chearful as ever he had ſeen him; but was concern'd to ſee him lay'd after ſo poor a manner upon the ground, and asking the reaſon of it; his Servants ſignified, that it was in Obedience to his own Orders, they had made his Bed in that manner; and that he would ſcarſe, thô in ſo weak a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, admit of any help from them; and had alſo deſir'd his Wife, for his, as well as for her own greater comfort (being he ſaw ſhe ſuffer'd

Brother <hi>Clare,</hi> thô pleas'd to ſee him, as Mr. <hi>Ruiſſon</hi> alſo ſeem'd to be with his Viſit, yet was troubl'd to ſee him ſo ill accoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated; and therefore beg'd of him, to accept at leaſt of ſuch helps and conveniences, as that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous condition he was in requir'd, that might conduce both to his eaſe in his ſickneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute alſo to his recovery; for the manner he had order'd himſelf to be treated, could not but much augment his diſtemper, which of it ſelf was already too great. To all which he reply'd, <hi>That could he be without thoſe conveniencies he ſtill had, he should be very glad; and if he did but know what comfort he receiv'd by the want of thoſe he had depriv'd himſelf of, he would rather preſs him to quit thoſe he had left, than deſire him to admit of others;</hi> and then asked Brother <hi>Clare, VVhether he thought the Inconveniencies he ſuffer'd were comparable to thoſe which our Saviour had ſuffer'd, for his ſake?</hi> And farther aver'd, <hi>That the only trouble he now felt, was, that he could not ſuffer more at his Death; to expreſs his Love to him, that dyed with ſo much pain for him upon the Croſs.</hi> He expreſſed this with ſuch a chearful and unconcern'd Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as made Brother <hi>Clare</hi> not think him to be in that danger, that others thought he was in; otherwiſe he would have given himſelf the comfort and advantage of being preſent at his Death: Which happen'd the ſame Night he left him. He giving no leſs evidence of his Vertue
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56701:125"/>at his Death, than he had done in his Life; not only by a perfect: Reſignation to Gods Will in ſuffering it; but by earneſtly deſiring, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>To be diſſolv'd, and to be with Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Perhaps the occaſion of this great Friendſhip, he expreſt both to Brother and Siſter <hi>Clare,</hi> proceeded from thoſe Inclinations he found in himſelf, to do what they had done; and in this without doubt Almighty God made him a kind of living Martyr; even by the too great Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Perſon, he loved moſt in the World (I mean his Wife) who out of the tender Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſhe had for him, never would give her conſent, for their retirement into Religion; thô he had frequently deſir'd it, with very great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: And this kind cruelty of hers, was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſo great a croſs, as nothing but his Love to Gods Will could ſweeten, and render ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: The truth of which he one Day confidently diſcover'd to Brother <hi>Clare;</hi> for diſcourſing with him about the happineſs of a Religious Vocation, he told him in Confidence, <hi>That it was a double favor, that God had beſtow'd upon him, in giving him ſuch a Vocation, in the State he was in; and at the ſame time affording him, the means of putting it in execution, by giving his Lady the ſame inclination. God indeed,</hi> ſays he, <hi>has been ſo good as to grant me the firſt, by letting me ſee the happineſs of a Religious State, and giving me very earneſt deſires of entering into Religion; but as yet he has vouchſafed to give me little hopes of putting theſe in execution; not perceiving he gives the ſame to my VVife;</hi> and added, <hi>that he
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56701:126"/>found it very hard to receive ſuch a Mortification, as a refuſal was, to ſo advantagious a requeſt, from a perſon he ſo intirely lov'd, and who alſo refus'd it out of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of love to him; wherefore he thought this ſo great an affliction, as 'twas impoſsible for any one to conceive the greatneſs of it, that did not actually feel it.</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>A remarkable paſſage of her burning her Picture, a little before her Death.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>'TIS a common Axiom in Philoſophy, that motion (for example, in a Stone caſt down from a high place) the nearer it comes to the end, or Center to which it tends, the more ſwift it is. Siſter <hi>Clares</hi> example ſeems to prove, that the ſame Axiom holds no leſs in Moral than in Natural Philoſophy; for thô from her firſt Converſion to the Catholic Faith, and her entrance into Religion, which immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the other, ſhe never ſtopt; but ſtill made a conſtant and continual progreſs in Perfection; managing each pretious moment of time to the beſt advantage, to prepare her ſelf for a happy Eternity; ſtill advanceing towards her end and Center of her affections, God himſelf: Yet there is one inſtance of her Zeal, that happen'd a little before her Death, which manifeſtly proves that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:56701:126"/>the nearer ſhe approacht her end, the ſwifter progreſs ſhe made; and thô perhaps what I am about to relate, may at the firſt fight appear to ſome leſs conſiderable; yet whoſoever ſhall right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weigh it, cannot but be of my opinion, that it far exceeded the other actions of her Life; expreſſing a ſtrange fund of Humility, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of her ſelf, and ſolid Piety; which alſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences that the lower ſhe hereby debaſt her ſelf, in her own thoughts, the higher ſhe was rais'd in Gods eſteem, and in a very ſhort time mounted to ſuch a hight of Perfection, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd immediately to be Crown'd.</p>
                  <p>Brother <hi>Clare,</hi> long before he, or ſhe had any thoughts of Religion, had procur'd her Picture to be drawn in Miniature, by that famous and renown'd Artiſt Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi> which being extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well done , and very like her , he cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſet in Gold, with a Criſtal before it. This Picture he ſent to her with other things to <hi>Graveling,</hi> ſuppoſing ſhe would beſtow them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Children : As ſoon as they came, ſhe beg'd leave to diſpofe of the Picture; Mother Abbeſs thinking ſhe deſir'd this leave, that ſhe might give it to one of her Children, told her ſhe might diſpoſe of it as ſhe pleas'd; ſhe had no ſooner obtain'd Mother Abbeſſes conſent, but ſhe preſently endeavour'd to get the Picture out of the Caſe; and what a Workman could ſcarce have done with Tools in a Quarter of an hours time, Providence, helpt her with a Pin only, to take out in a moment (even to her own admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:56701:127"/>as ſhe afterwards declar'd) and leſt her deſign ſhould be diſcover'd, before ſhe could meet with a conveniency of burning it; ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſcratcht the Face all over with the ſame Pin, with which ſhe had taken it out of the Caſe, and as ſoon as ſhe came to the Fire, ſo dextrouſly threw it in, that none perceiv'd it. Not long after, Reverend Mother Abbeſs asking for the Picture, Siſter <hi>Clare</hi> ingenuouſly told her what ſhe had done with it, having had her leave, to diſpoſe of it as ſhe pleas'd: And Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Clare</hi> hearing alſo ſhe had burnt it, and ſome time after Expoſtulating with her, for having depriv'd the Children of ſo comfortable a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as that would have been to them; ſhe made him this Anſwer, <hi>That she was ſorry she had done what she found was diſpleaſing to him, which he would not have diſapprov'd had he reflected how fit it was, that the Picture, of what she had taken ſo much Pride in, should come to no better an end, than the Original deſerv'd;</hi> Ingeniouſly covering and excuſing one act of Humility with another. This ſeem'd to be the laſt Action that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty had reſerv'd, for the compleating of her Crown; for the very Morning that the Coppy thus periſh'd, the Original was ſeiz'd on by her laſt Sickneſs, as if the Humility ſhe had expreſt in burning her Picture, had obtain'd of God to perfect the Original, and render it more like his own Image, by calling her to his Beatifical Viſion; St. <hi>Iohn</hi> aſſuring us, <hi>VVe shall be like him when we shall ſee him as he is;</hi> Providence alſo hereby
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56701:127"/>manifeſting, that the more earneſtly ſhe deſir'd to be forgot by Creatures, the more ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred and rewarded by her Creator. So that whilſt Siſter <hi>Clare</hi> thus fervently endeavour'd in a little time, to make up a great Crown, by a faithful practice of all Vertues; eſpecially, of a profound Humility, the foundation of them all; Almighty God, as I before hinted, deſign'd to put a Period to her Vertuous courſe; judging it time to reward the labors of ſo Penitential a Life, as her love had caus'd her both to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for his ſake; and to make ſuch wonderful progreſs in, as I have recounted: Whereby ſhe deſerv'd the Encomium, which the Holy Ghoſt gives a fervent Soul, <hi>Viz.</hi> that ſhe had conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated or heapt together in a ſhort time, ſo great a ſtock or Treaſure of Vertue and Merits, as others in a long time, even in many Years were not able to obtain.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Foreſight God gave her of her Death, her concern for her Fathers Converſion, and her Letters to him about it.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE reward that God often beſtows upon perſons of an extraordinary Piety and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Life, is a foreſight and knowledge of their Death; both to animate them to ſpend the ſhort time that remains, to make up their Crown with greater fervor; and the better to prepare themſelves for this change, by a frequent Reſignation, and ardent deſires of a happy diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that ends in the beginning of an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Union with himſelf. 'Tis probable, as we may gather from that which follows, that God had beſtow'd this favor upon Siſter <hi>Clare;</hi> for whom Reverend Mother Abbeſs being much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen'd, by reaſon of the accident which that Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had happen'd to her, of falling into a ſound in the Quire, (ſhe having no leſs kindneſs and tenderneſs for her, than her Predeceſſor had) went to Viſit her in the Infirmary, whether ſhe had order'd her to retire her ſelf, to try if ſhe could repoſe; thinking nothing better for her: Where finding ſhe had got two or three hours reſt, Mother Abbeſs was much comforted to ſee her ſo
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:56701:128"/>extraordinary chearful, as ſhe ſeem'd to be; hereupon ſhe told her, ſhe thought the worſt was now paſt; and expreſt how comforted ſhe was to ſee her ſo well. She ſmiling told Mother Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs, <hi>That she thanked God she found her ſelf ready and moſt perfectly reſign'd to embrace his Holy VVill in all things, and therefore had no apprehenſions at all of Death; nay, if she could deſire one thing more than another, it would be rather to die, than live: And that which now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted her, was the thought that this would be her laſt Sickneſs.</hi> Reverend Mother Abbeſs earneſtly deſir'd her to lay aſide theſe thoughts, telling her there was not the leaſt appearance of any danger of Death; and that ſhe hop't ſoon to ſee her as well again, as ever ſhe was in her Life: But ſhe Anſwer'd with a ſmiling Countenance, full of comfort and conformity. <hi>Dear Mother, God has now decided a Queſtion (which I have often thought of with no ſmall trouble)</hi> Viz. <hi>VVhether Brother</hi> Clare <hi>or I should die firſt? For knowing how great an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, the Death of either would be to the ſurviver; and diffiding in my own strength and ability to bear ſuch a croſs; and on the other ſide compaſsionating the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, which I am ſure he would ſuffer, I durſt never beg the one, or the other. But now it is Gods VVill that I should go firſt, and this Sickeſs is to carry me to my Grave. I doubt not, but his Infinite goodneſs, who deſigns to give Brother Clare this Croſs, will alſo give him strength to bear it.</hi> This paſſage alone is an undeniable Argument, as I ſaid before, of her being a Favourite of Heaven, and evidently ſhews the great Union ſhe had with God in
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:56701:129"/>Prayer, and is a ſignal token of her great Conformity to the Will of her Heavenly Father.</p>
                  <p>After ſhe had imparted this ſad and Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal News to Reverend Mother Abbeſs, her Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor grew more violent, which finding a Body ſo exhauſted and broken, it ſoon got the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery over Nature, and render'd her unable to take any farther care or charge of her Children; yet did not hinder her from proſecuting her Pious endeavours for her Fathers Converſion; by making uſe of that little ſtrength ſhe had left, to Write at different times the following Letter.</p>

                        <p>WHilſt I was making a ſtrict iniquiry, how I might ſpeedily, and ſecurely ſend you another Letter, in hopes that before I die, your goodneſs would move you to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe me the comfort of ſuch an Anſwer, as my heart most paſsionately longs for; Providence was pleas'd to bring a Gentleman this way, who has kindly offer'd me the ſafe conveyance of this Letter into your hands; wherefore, thô I very lately troubl'd you with one, and thô Writing in the weak condition I am in, gives me a great deal of pain; yet that of the Body is nothing in reſpect of the pain my Soul ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, as often as I reflest upon the danger yours is in; and that the Eternal happineſs of that, depends upon the uncertain moments of this tranſitory Life. Wherefore Dear Sir, once more upon my Knees, I humbly beg your Bleſsing, which perhaps will be the laſt time I shall ask it, and alſo beg the comfort of hearing of your health, which I hope is good, thô I thank God mine is at preſent in a very low condition; his Divine Will be done in me, who does all things for the best. Alas Sir, when I conſider that we are all Mortal, and that there is an Eternity of Happineſs or Miſery that attends us; how can I refrain from being
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:56701:130"/>thus troubleſome?

How then can the pain that my Heart feels be conceal'd? Or indeed, how can I expreſs what I feel, till you are out of danger; and in ſuch a condition, as Death may be welcome to you, whenever it comes? For God's ſake Sir think of it, ſurely ſuch a number of Martyrs, and Learned Confeſſors, have not diſpiſed the World, and ſuffer'd, for nothing; Oh no, God ſpeaks to us in every thing, and all the Benefits that we receive, every moment proclaim his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; who requires nothing but that we <hi>Believe,</hi> be <hi>Sorry,</hi> and be <hi>Saved.</hi> And when we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in, and love Ieſus Crucified, that we hate our ſelves for having offended ſo much love: Having done this, what he requires for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, instead of ſeeming hard, will prove ſweet and eaſie. And ſo I doubt not but it will to you (Dear Sir) if at my humble request you will do this; and that you will find ſuch a joy and comfort in the doing it, as all your past Life could never afford you.

                  </argument>
                  <p>ONE would have thought that the infinite goodneſs of God, which permits him not to be behind hand with his Creatures, ſeeing her in the interior affliction ſhe ſuffer'd, upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her Father, as the foreſaid Letters ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently expreſs; as well as the exterior ſhe felt from her Sickneſs, and a want of thoſe helps to bear it, which the Auſterity of her Order per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not the uſe of, and which her love for him had therefore made her chooſe, loving ſuffering above all things in this World, becauſe it was the beſt expreſſion ſhe could make of her love to him: I ſay, one would have thought that the goodneſs of God would have mov'd him to temper, and ſweeten theſe great afflictions, with ſome interior Comforts; but it happen'd, that his Providence dealt quite otherwiſe with her, not out of a want of Love, but out of an abundance of it; who ſeeing the fidelity and courage, with which ſhe ſerv'd him, and her conſtant Conformity to his Divine Will, even in the hardeſt things; and knowing alſo, what an Eternal weight of Glory, theſe momentary ſufferings gain'd for her, and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:56701:132"/>that the more pure her ſufferings were, the greater alſo was her gain; ſeem'd to withdraw himſelf together with all interior comforts that accompany a ſenſible feeling of his preſence, ſo intirely from her, that ſhe thought he had totally abandon'd, and forſaken her; thô ſtill he reſided in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of her heart, and inviſibly aſſiſted her to bear this moſt ſenſible affliction. Declaring one Day theſe her ſufferings to a Siſter that came to Viſit her, who was a great confident of hers, ſhe deſir'd her to Pray for her, that ſhe might intirely abandon her ſelf to Gods Will; and ſignified to her how great an addition it was to the Mortification her ſickneſs brought with it, that it depriv'd her of Religious obſervance; eſpecially, that of the Divine Office. Another time ſhe expreſt her ſelf to thoſe that Viſited her in the following manner. <hi>Happy are you dear Siſters, that can aſsiſt in the Quire amongſt thoſe Seraphims</hi> (for ſo ſhe call'd the Religious) <hi>in praiſing and loving God, and can ſtill be punctual in the performance of all other things, that Religious Obſervance requires; alas, we never know a Benefit till we are depriv'd of it. How happy was I when I had ſtrength and abilities to perform, what our Rules require; but not juſtly acquĭtting my ſelf in the performance of them, God has juſtly placed me here, and taken that happineſs from me; to whom I humbly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; for I know his Infinite VViſdom thinks it beſt to have it ſo, his Holy VVill be done: <hi>Adding moreover,</hi> That it ſeem'd to her, ſince she had left theſe exerciſes, as if God alſo had abandon'd her; and that she had nothing now to comfort her ſelf withal; but the thoughts that
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:56701:132"/>he treated her no worſe then his own Son, whom alſo he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd for her ſake; all therefore she was able now to do, was to unite theſe her interior ſufferings and derelictions, to thoſe he ſuffer'd upon the Croſs, when he complain'd of his Eternal Fathers forſaking him; and beg'd of them to aſsiſt her with their Prayers, that she might bear this tryal, as she ought;</hi> teſtifying, <hi>that the pain it occaſion'd was ſo great, as that it had made her almoſt inſenſible of her exterior ſufferings, neither feeling the pain of her diſtemper, nor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting what was given her to Eat.</hi> One of the good Siſters thinking to give her eaſe in theſe her ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, at leaſt for ſome little time, deſir'd ſhe would admit of a Viſit from her Children; but ſhe knowing, how much her indiſpoſition had chang'd her from what ſhe had been formerly, was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; for fear ſhe ſhould not have ſtrength enough to maintain that equality of mind, which ſhe had till then expreſt in ſuch like occaſions; yet after much intreaty ſhe gave her conſent, that they ſhould be brought to her; no ſooner were they come to the Bed-ſide, but ſhe fell a weeping. This unexpected accident made them preſently be taken away from her, and after they were gone, the Siſter asked her, the cauſe of her Tears, ſhe anſwer'd, <hi>'twas my tenderneſs that made me VVeep, being well I had often much a do to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the expreſſing the ſentiments of a Mother; but now being overcome by ſickneſs, I cannot overcome my ſelf.</hi> Then the Siſter asked her, <hi>How she had attain'd to that great Mortification, and conqueſt over Nature?</hi> She reply'd, <hi>That from the moment she left Brother</hi> Clare, <hi>all things, but God were diſpleaſing to her, and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:56701:133"/>that the Children putting her in mind of that other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which she had made to God, caus'd her a new to ſettle her Affections upon her Creator, which by the aſſistance of his Divine Grace, could not be alter'd by any Creature.</hi> Perhaps the thoughts, that this was the laſt time ſhe ſhould ever ſee them in this World, and that they were to be left to the care of ſtrangers, or elſe expos'd to a dangerous Education by their Proteſtant Relations, might occaſion her tenderneſs in this Viſit, which ſhe overcame in the next; in which the Children were alſo taken from her, upon account of their own, arid not of their Mothers Tears.

                  </argument>
                  <p>'TIS a ſtrange and wonderful Paradox, that affliction ſhould be a mark of Love; yet the Divine Wiſdom, Truth it ſelf has declar'd, <hi>That God Chaſtiſes thoſe he Loves.</hi> If this therefore be true as certainly 'tis, his Love to Siſter <hi>Clare</hi> was very extraordinary, who gave her ſo many marks of it, by ſending her ſo many afflictions: But one comfort ſhe expreſt to have ſtill left, was, that ſhe ſhould die before Brother <hi>Clare;</hi> but God would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her long to enjoy this neither; and would alſo give her this tryal, even when ſhe was in ſo very weak a condition, as made her leſs able to bear it, <hi>Viz.</hi> the ſuſpition of Brother <hi>Clares</hi> Death, which happen'd from his unwonted ſilence to ſeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhe had Writ to him, and in ſome of them about the Children's concerns, which ſhe knew he would not fail to Anſwer by the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56701:134"/>and becauſe ſhe was diſappointed in this, ſhe imagin'd, that he was dead; and under that conviction ſuffer'd as much, as if he had been truly ſo; yet ſhe ſilently underwent this hidden affliction for a long time with that cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as not to diſcover any outward ſign of grief at all; till at laſt her want of ſtrength, forc't her at leaſt to a change of Countenance, caus'd by this following accident. She giving ſome Letters which ſhe had Writ to Brother <hi>Clare,</hi> to ſend by a Father that was going to <hi>Liege;</hi> the Siſter that was to carry them to the Father, finding them open, deſir'd her to Seal them, upon which propoſal they diſcern'd a more then ordinary change in her Countenance; which proceeded, as afterwards ſhe own'd, from the Confirmation this action of the Siſter gave to the ſuſpition ſhe before had of his Death; ſhe believing that to hide it, ſuch care was taken that ſhe ſhould Seal her Letters. This certainly was one of the greateſt tryals that could befal her, or that could call her conſtancy in the love of God to a more than ordinary Teſt. If you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know the conflict ſhe felt, and how ſhe behaved her ſelf in it, take it in her own words, as I find amongſt her Papers, ſhe gave account of it to her Ghoſtly Father. <hi>The Combat I had, and how I wholy offer'd up Brother</hi> Clare <hi>to Almighty God, which I beſeech him, our Bleſſed Lady, and all my Patrons and Patroneſſes, to aſſit me to keep: I by Almighty Gods Grace reſolv'd to make this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to his greater Honor and Glory; and when I heard the Maſs Bell Ring, my heart trembl'd, and I was all
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:56701:134"/>in a Commotion; the firſt thing as I remember I did was to fancy him dead, and ſo I preſented him at our Bleſſed Ladies Feet, and beſeecht her to offer him up for me; I beg'd alſo the ayd of St.</hi> Bruno <hi>and St.</hi> Tereſa, <hi>and then I reſolv'd never to deſire to ſee him, and if he should come, never to look on him, to put him clearly out of my heart, to be no more concern'd in him than a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; then it came into my mind to behold him dead, and to ſay to Almighty God I was glad of it, and would have it ſo, ſince he was pleas'd to have it ſo, but this cut my heart into a thouſand pieces: Then I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd I would never give my ſelf any pleaſure, in talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him or ſuffer my ſelf to feel that contentment in heaving of him, or from him; then I reſign'd my ſelf, that he should perſecute me, and that he should have no concern in me, then I preſum'd to take our Savior for my Spouſe, and reſolv'd to go to him and complain in all my troubles, as I us'd to do to Brother</hi> Clare, <hi>to rejoyce to hear him prais'd or well ſpoken of, and ſo perfectly turn the ſtream of my affections intirely to our Savior; but then I thought how durſt I take our Savior for my Spouſe, I was not pure enough for that; this kept me back and dasht all my joy; but methought, howſoever, thô I did not feel that quietneſs I hop't, yet he would accept of me; and ſo I preſum'd to do it. Then again methougbt I muſt never ſpeak of that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection we had for one another, which I reſolv'd never to do; then God enabl'd me to make an act of reſignation to his Death, for I am ſure I could do nothing of my ſelf; ſo that now I go imagining him dead, and I will ſtrive to think there was never ſuch a Perſon. After this I reſolv'd to confirm all this by Vow, if my

                  </p>
                  <p>The great kindneſs ſhe here expreſſes for Brother <hi>Clare,</hi> gave her without doubt the chief cauſe of that trouble, which the apprehenſion of his Death oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd; but that which extreamly augmented this affliction, was the confirmation that this appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion gave her, of the truth of another ſuſpition (which as I before mention'd had extreamly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted her) that ſhe was left and abandon'd by Almighty God; perceiving her ſelf deluded, in two points ſhe thought God had revealed to her, <hi>Viz.</hi> her dying of that ſickneſs, and that ſhe ſhould dye before Brother <hi>Clare:</hi> She now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Heaven had decided the Queſtion, contrary to what ſhe had before communicated to Reverend Mother Abbeſs. In theſe continual convulſions of doubts and fears, ſhe remain'd for about two Months, in a very languiſhing condition of health; and during all that time, had an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of making as many Sacrifices of Brother <hi>Clare,</hi> as ſhe had thoughts of him. And it ſeem'd to be a more than an ordinary effect of Providence, that ſo many Letters ſhould meet with ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate miſ-carriages at this time; for thô Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56701:135"/>
                     <hi>Clare</hi> receiv'd, and Anſwer'd every Letter ſhe Writ; yet not one of his Anſwers came to her hands; Almighty God foreſeeing what an addition would be made to her Crown by this interruption of Correſpondence; by reaſon of the infinite acts of reſignation ſhe dayly made to Gods Holy Will, in bearing his ſuppos'd Death, with ſo ſingular and invincible a patience, even in that low and weak condition ſhe was in, her forces ſeeming to be quite exhauſted; yet neither by ſighing, or any other exterior Mark of grief, did ſhe ever give any ſign of this interior ſorrow ſhe ſuffer'd; which without doubt was the greater, the more it was ſuppreſt. Perhaps we had never come to a perfect and intire knowledge of this great and ſenſible afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhe ſo couragiouſly underwent (thô her Paper mentions part of it) had not Mother Abbeſs, when one Day ſhe came to Viſit her, acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally askt her, whether any thing troubl'd her; bidding her tell her, if there did: When behold the love ſhe had for prompt Obedience, overcame that, which before ſhe had expreſt for ſilent ſuffering; for without any more a do, and without the leaſt paſſion, ſhe told her, <hi>Dear Mother I believe Brother</hi> Clare <hi>is Dead, which I ſuppoſe out of too much kindneſs and Charity towards me, you endeavour to conceal from me, knowing how unable I am to bear ſo great an affliction; but if God pleaſe to have it ſo, his Holy VVill be done, he who gave him to me, and now gives me this croſs by taking him from me, hows what is beſt for me; whoſe goodneſs, as I conſide, will aſſiſt me to ſuffer, whatever his
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:56701:136"/>VViſdom thinks best to ordain.</hi> Mother Abbeſs us'd the beſt Arguments ſhe could to convince her, that her apprehenſion was without ground; but Siſter <hi>Clare</hi> inſiſting upon his ſilence as an infallible argument of his Death; Mother Abbeſs could not ſo well Anſwer it, having receiv'd for a long time no Letters from him; but was forc't to leave her ſtill in a doubt and apprehenſion, that what ſhe ſuſpected might be true. But the next Day there came a Packet of Letters from <hi>Liege,</hi> which Mother Abbeſs no ſooner receiv'd, but ſhe carry'd it with all ſpeed to Siſter <hi>Clare;</hi> telling her with a great deal of joy, that ſhe had brought ſuch a convincing Argument along with her, that Brother <hi>Clare</hi> was not dead, as ſhe could not give her the laſt time ſhe was with her; <hi>Viz.</hi> a Letter ſhe had juſt receiv'd from him to her. She receiv'd this welcome news with a great deal of joy, declaring it was a double comfort to her to find he was in good health, and that the ſtrong inſpiration ſhe had receiv'd of her dying before him, that ſhe had alſo inform'd her of, prov'd no illuſion, as ſhe fear'd it had been: But added that the Letter came too late for her to be able to read it, or indeed, to hear it Read at preſent, finding her Head ſo weak, as that ſhe could not attend to it; nor indeed was ſhe afterwards ſo well as either to deſire any one to Read it, or did any one think her in a condition to propoſe the Reading of it to her: And 'tis moſt probable, her deſire to the very laſt, of ſeeking her greater Mortification in all things, as well as the memory
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:56701:136"/>of the Vow, which with her Confeſſors permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhe had made, <hi>of never giving her ſelf any ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in hearing of him, or from him,</hi> made her take the pretence of her weakneſs, to deny her ſelf the ſatisfaction, which hearing the Letter would have given her. Thô the truth is ſhe was extreamly weak, her ſtrength dayly diminiſhing, thô the Doctor did not apprehend her ſo near her Death as in reality ſhe was; ſhe never expreſſing to him, or to thoſe that attended her, any thing at all of what ſhe felt or ſuffer'd; and therefore all that he could frame a judgment from, were the gueſſes of others, as well of his own from her pulſe; which having been weak and low for a long time, he thought ſhe might ſtill hold out a good while; thô he believ'd ſhe would never recover from that ſickneſs. The only concern ſhe had now left, was for her Fathers Converſion, and what would become of the Children after her Death; which the thoughts of Brother <hi>Clares</hi> Death, had for ſome time hinder'd her from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon.</p>

This render'd the Religious rather ſharers in her ſufferings, than inabl'd them to give her any comfort or ſolace in them.

                  <p>THE Fourth Day after her Death, Reverend Father <hi>Seraphim</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Capuchin, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Preacher, as well as experienced Director of Souls. Who had been earneſtly deſir'd, and had kindly undertaken to make her Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, came to perform his promiſe; and to teſtifie to others, what in ſeveral occaſions, in which he had treated with her, he had been Witneſs of himſelf; eſpecially at that time, when ſhe had particularly deſir'd to adviſe with ſome experienced perſon, that was not of her own Nation, about her removal from <hi>Graveling;</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>English</hi> ſhe had conſulted, might be too much byaſt with a National affection, and upon that account, might diſſwade her from going amongſt Strangers; but he prov'd to be of the ſame ſentiment with Reverend Father <hi>VVorſley,</hi> and other <hi>English,</hi> ſhe had advis'd with in this point; and aſſur'd her, that it was a pure Temptation, thô the Enemy had cunningly Cloak't and cover'd it with the ſpecious pretence, that ſhe ſhould find more Mortification, and leſs eſteem among Strangers, than ſhe receiv'd

Wherefore ſays he, <hi>if the VViſe Man</hi> Eccleſiaſticus <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>declares, that he who ſought not after, nor hop't in Riches had done wonders, I may ſay her Courage was wonderful; ſince she not only not ſought, but forſook and quitted, not only Riches, but Father, Husband, Children, and all other happineſſes this VVorld could afford, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low more exactly the Counſels of our Savior, thereby to be the better able to take up and embrace his Croſs, and follow him. Which brings me to the third mark of her Courage I promis'd to explicate in my third Point.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Third Point he prov'd, how ſhe expreſt her Courage by the choice of ſo rigorous an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, diſcribing the Auſterities of it, which ſhe was not content with, but animated with the lik Zeal Sc. <hi>Francis Xavarius</hi> was, when he cry'd out, <hi>Lord let me ſtill ſuffer more,</hi> he declar'd how earneſtly ſhe had expreſt to him her deſire to go to a more rigorous Order amongſt Strangers, where ſhe might ſuffer more, and be known or regarded leſs; all which he expreſt after ſo pathetical a manner, as amongſt his numerous Auditory, there was ſcarſe a dry Eye to be found; who by this his Diſcourſe were convinc't, that thô they came with a great Idea of her Sanctity, yet it was far ſhort of what they found ſhe was endow'd withal.</p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:56701:142"/>
                  <p>At the end of the Fathers Sermon, ſhe was carried from the Quire, where ſhe lay expos'd in her Habit, down to the Cloyſter to be Buried next to Mother <hi>Taylor,</hi> her firſt Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs, and great friend as has been before ſaid. It happen'd in the diging of her Grave, that they broke into Mother <hi>Taylors,</hi> out of which there came a ſcent no leſs fragrant than that, which the Body of Siſter <hi>Clare</hi> ſent forth: Their ſweet Odors being thus united after Death, as their Affections had been whilſt they liv'd. Reverend Mother Abbeſs deſirous that the memory of her example ſhould continue as long as the Monaſtry laſted, cauſed a great Marble Grave-ſtone to be lay'd over her Body, which Reverend Father <hi>Francis VVilliams,</hi> then Rector of the Noviſhip of the <hi>Society of Ieſus,</hi> of the <hi>English</hi> Province at <hi>VVatten,</hi> adorn'd with this enſuing Epitaph, which I put in the Language in which 'tis Writ upon the Grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, <hi>Viz.</hi> in Latin; and alſo in <hi>English,</hi> that the meaning of it may be underſtood by all of our own Nation, for whom this Life was chiefly Writ.</p>

                        <p>THE Will of God be ever done, Life and Death are in his Hands, and all works are perfected in mercy and goodneſs. I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken my Pen in hand upon the ſaddest ſubject,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:56701:144"/>that could have happen'd to me, or this Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and were I not reſolv'd never to let my Will jarre with the Will of God, I ſhould want reſignation to this preſent viſitation, which has depriv'd us of your, and our ever dear Sister, Sister <hi>Clare</hi> of Ieſus; whom Ieſus her dear Spouſe called to his Eternal embraces, on the <hi>26th.</hi> Instant; Having left us a greater affliction, I am bold to ſay, than ever any conceived at the Death of their own Natural Siſters. For in her we lost a great light of Vertue, more than I am able to expreſs, ſince her generous embracing of our Abjections, did incourage us in our Vocations. I never heard her complain, nor repine at our Auſterities, but I have often heard her ſay, that they were too little, and that she did nothing as she ought for the love of God. Her Humility engag'd her to make uſe of all means to cover her Vertue; yet I cannot frame to my ſelf how any one could have liv'd more perfectly, than she has done theſe few Years, that she hath been with us. Her perfection appear'd ſo much in all she did, that it is hard to ſay in what she was most perfect. I never could ſee how any one could be more prompt, ſimple, or blindly Obedient, than she was; and yet she was always accuſing her ſelf of her want of it. O how clear ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are Saints! This made her to ſay dayly to
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:56701:145"/>me, when I came to Viſit her in her Sickneſs, that she ſcarce thought her ſelf Religious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe she had never done any action in her Life time like a Religious Woman. Dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what great Humility was this? That did ſo wean her from all ſelf-opinion, when the Life she led was ſuch, as I am ſure none can ſurpaſs. In her Sickneſs she us'd to expreſs her Conformity in ſuch like words as theſe, It has pleas'd God to ſend me ſuch, or ſuch a tryal, or to deprive me of ſuch, or ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. This ſhew'd, that she took all from the immediate hand of God, and that her Sickneſs did not (as her Humility made her believe) rob her, of her former near Vnion with him, as far as I could perceive; but when he ſeem'd to withdraw himſelf from her, it was without doubt the greatest Affliction in her Sickneſs, and conſequently an effect of his Love to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe her Merit. Dear Brother, I wish that you had ſeen her dying as we did, what profit would you have made of ſuch an example? That God did not think us fit to enjoy any longer. I wish I could do by her, as our Bleſſed Lady did by her dear Son, lay up in my Heart all the Words and Actions of her Life, as a Rule whereby to ſquare my own. There has been little other Diſcourſe ſince her happy Death, but of her Vertuous Life; and I wish that it
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:56701:145"/>may always continue amongst us, to excite us to a faithful Imitation of her, as the best means of meeting her once more in Heaven. What reaſon have we then but to confide in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent happineſs? She knew that Heaven ſuffer'd violence, and therefore reſolv'd to be one of thoſe that ſhould take it by force. Whilſt ſhe was well, her Life was a continu'd practice of Religious Perfection, and her Sickneſs was nothing but an encreaſe of her Merit, becauſe she ſuffer'd it with ſo much love and patience. She would often ſweetly invite Death, that is dreadful and ugly to most, to come and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch and not linger about her.</p>
                        <p>We are now Writeing to all the Convents, as we uſe to do upon ſuch occaſions, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Prayers for her; thô I believe we want her Prayers, more than she does ours; I shall dayly beg at her Grave, that she would obtain comfort for you, and that you may bear this Croſs with a reſign'd Patience. Our whole Community is full of Affliction, and I hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee what I Write, my Eyes are ſo full of Tears, I wish they may Redeem yours. As for her two ſweet Children, if you pleaſe to intrust your dear Sister and me with them, by Gods Grace, they shall never want a Mother, in what lies in my Power to ſerve them; and I shall always look upon it as an obligation, and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:56701:146"/>pledge of that Treaſure their dear Mother, whom God has been pleaſed to deprive us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

I must confeſs my weakneſs in not well bearing ſo great a Croſs, and our Community is in ſuch a melancholly temper, that we are incapable of giving them any comfort upon her death. For this reaſon I ſent for Reverend Father Rector of <hi>Watten,</hi> who has acted the part of a Comforter, both to them, and us.

She was indeed the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, and Mirror of a true Religious Soul; there could not poſsibly be any one more diſ-engag'd from all things here below, than she was; for, that short time that God was pleas'd to lend her to us, nothing but God, nothing but Heaven was in her Heart, and Month. All other Diſcourſes and entertainments were te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to her, as I am confident you know very well; yet notwithſtanding all theſe guſts and comforts that her Soul taſted in thinking of her Heavenly Spouſe, ſhe ſeem'd, as ſhe thought, to be perfectly forſaken by him in her laſt Sickneſs. wherefore I cannot be perſwaded but God us'd this means to purifie her Soul, that it might fly directly into his loving embraces, where 'tis at preſent abſorpt in Eternal delights. But becauſe the Iudgments of God are ſecret, I will never ceaſe to remember her dayly in my Poor Devotions.</p>

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:56701:147"/>Contempt of her ſelf, which is the foundation of all other Vertues, was ſuch, as that the most Ambitious Perſon could not more earneſtly ſeek after Honor, than she ſought in all things, her greatest Abne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and Humiliation; neither was she content to have this low and mean esteem of her ſelf, but earnestly deſir'd to imprint the ſame in the minds of all others; taking all occaſions she was able of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and when she found her endeavors had not the deſir'd effect; but according to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viors promiſe <hi>(Qui ſe humiliat exaltabitur, He that humbles himſelf ſhall be exalted)</hi> that the more pains she took to leſſen, the more she gain'd esteem, it cannot be imagin'd, what an affliction this was to her; which the Enemy took an occaſion to push on to ſuch an exceſs, that had she not had that ſubmiſsion to her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors, which was admirable in her, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd their advice, rather than her own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; this affliction had caus'd her to leave this place to go amongst Strangers. The only fault she found with it, being the too much esteem and reſpect she receiv'd from the Religious, which was to her humble Spirit as great a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, as the want of it can be, even to the proudest heart. Her Love and Practice of Mortification and Abnegation was alſo very extraordinary: Nor would permit her to rest ſatisfied with the ordinary Austerities of the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:56701:148"/>Rule (which were even too great for her delicate and tender Complexion to ſuffer) unleſs she added others to them; and my refuſing her leave to practice the Pennances she ſo earneſtly deſir'd, I believe was a greater Mortification, than they themſelves could have been to her. I often thought, whilſt ſhe as earnestly Petition'd for leave to practice extraordinary Mortifications, as if ſhe had beg'd for her Life, of the agreement of her Spirit, with that of St. <hi>Tereſa</hi>'s, her great Paironeſs, who beg'd of God ſo earnestly, <hi>Either to permit her to ſuffer or to die;</hi> and that which mov'd Sister <hi>Clare</hi> chiefly to this ardent deſire of ſuffering for God, was her extraordinary Love of him, better exprest, as ſhe thought, by ſuffering, than any way elſe; and therefore, what ſhe could not get leave to practice exteriorly, ſhe interiorly ſupply'd, by violently contradicting and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming her paſſions, and even lawful inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in ſuch a manner, as to keep her ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly upon the rack; never giving the least way to Nature, but curbing it upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; ſo that her dayly Converſation with her Children, which ſeem'd to others a comfort, was to her without doubt a great occaſion of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, it giving nature an occaſion of a continual conflict, over which ſhe constantly got the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. Her Conformity to God's Will, and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:56701:148"/>Abnegation of her own, appear'd no leſs admirable in her blind and prompt Obedience, than in receiving from his hands, whatever his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence vouchſaft to ſend by others, and what was most contrary to Fleſh and Blood, ſeem'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways most pleaſing and welcome to her. By theſe steps of Humility, Mortification, and Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, ſhe had rais'd her ſelf to ſuch an Vnion with God, as was wonderful; walking always in his preſence, which no employment or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident could deprive her off. And all the time she had free to her ſelf, she ſpent in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Contemplation or Communication with his Divine Majesty, who was not wanting on his part in replenishing her Soul with ſuch extraordinary Lights and Graces, as still animated and ſtrengthned her in the constant purſuite of the highest Perfection. Nor was she ſo abſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:56701:149"/>muſt own I never met in a Soul a greater deſire of ſuffering for God; a greater Vnion and Conformity, nay, and ſatisfaction too, as to the Superior part, even in the greateſt of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, than I did in her; eſpecially in her laſt Sickneſs, where it pittied my heart to ſee what she ſuffer'd, as I before mention'd; yet was comforted at the ſame time to ſee with what Constancy, Courage and Conformity she under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went this, even the greatest of tryals; for as 'tis the greatest act of Mortification, or Abnegation, to be content to looſe or leave God for God; ſo the ſame is alſo the greatest act of Love a Creature can expreſs to it's Creator. Wherefore I cannot but piouſly believe, that she Reigns now with him in Heaven, whom he had prepar'd for this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs by adorning her with ſo many Celestial Verlues upon Earth. I have been longer than I deſign'd, but the ſubject I doubt not will plead my excuſe, and obtain your pardon, having no other deſign then your comfort by it, being glad of this as I shall be of any other occaſion of expreſſing how much I am,</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>A Deſcription in General of the Sanctity of her Life.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT may ſeem ſtrange, that after the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Two ſuch Perſons, who had an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of inſpecting the whole Tenor of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and interior Life ſhe led, I ſhould ſtill proceed to give further evidences of her Sanctity. But the Providence of Almighty God ſo ordain'd, that ſhe ſhould have as many Witneſſes, as there were Religious ſhe convers'd withal; that her Vertues prov'd by the Atteſtation of ſo many Irrefragable and unconteſtable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, might never hereafter be call'd in queſtion. In General then, take that Original Draught of her Sanctity, which they, as in ſo many lively Colours, have tranſmitted to me, and I think my ſelf oblig'd, to tranſmit to Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>They all ſpeak home to the ſame point, that Siſter <hi>Clare</hi> began, when ſhe came to Religion, where Perſons great Perfection left of. The chief thing ſhe aim'd at, was to be the Meaneſt in the Houſe of God, and upon that account, was always ſeeking after the pooreſt Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the better to ſerve the Community. Theſe Humiliations cover'd the good Religious
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:56701:150"/>with confuſion; bluſhing, and at the ſame time wondering to ſee a Perſon of her Quality (who had formerly ſo many to attend her) caſting her ſelf at their Feet, and condeſcending to things ſo abject and contrary to ſenſe. From this Humility as from a ſource, ſprung that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedneſs in ſpeaking any thing which might in the leaſt tend to her own praiſes, or thoſe of her Relations; if any occaſion offer'd to touch upon that ſubject, ſhe either kept a profound ſilence, or declin'd the Diſcourſe as ungrateful; or if Obedience put her upon it, the Meen and Modeſty with which ſhe deliver'd her ſelf, ſeem'd rather to diminiſh, than favor any ways the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and eſteem ſhe had gain'd in the World. As ſhe inviolably obſerv'd the time of ſilence, ſo ſhe was never heard to utter an idle word: If Charity or Superiors order'd her to ſpeak, the bent of her Diſcourſe was ſtill of God, or what tended to his Divine Service; ſhe never made an end of enlarging her ſelf upon his Divine Attributes, his Beauty, his Power, his Wiſdom, and Providence towards Creatures, but in particular upon his Mercy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Sinners, with reflection upon her ſelf, as if her Sins had deſerv'd greater puniſhments than all others. Yet theſe Pious Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments were ſo prudently manag'd, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon with that diſcretion, that there was nothing forc't or tedious in them. To this we may add, that whatſoever related to the Divine Service, ſhe thought could never ſufficiently be
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:56701:151"/>eſteem'd; and ſo high was the value ſhe put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Minute Ceremony, and Regular Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance, that even St. <hi>Clare</hi> (I have as many Authentic Vouchers for this, as there are Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious at <hi>Graveling</hi>) could not more exactly keep the Rules in their Primitive Vigor and Purity, than ſhe did. But that which charm'd her the moſt, in the Monaſtry of <hi>Graveling,</hi> was the retirdneſs and ſolitude of the Place, the rigour of the Habit, the poorneſs of the Dyet; and in a word, becauſe all things ſeem'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire her with her beloved Spirit of Pennance: For by her good Will, ſhe would have been always imitating thoſe Ancient Penitents (whoſe Lives ſhe had Read) to expiate the diſorders, as ſhe call'd them, of her Life paſt; hence ſhe gave no truce or ſolace to her wearied and exhauſted Body, which ſhe treated with Macerations of all ſorts, nor would afford any reſpite to Nature, being in effect a real Martyr every hour; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that had not Obedience put a reſtraint upon her fervor, theſe exceſſes would ſoon have ruin'd her health; yet ſtill theſe Mortifications were ſo temper'd with an exterior ſweetneſs, that no one could perceive that ſhe found the leaſt difficulty in the whole courſe of this Penitential Life.</p>
                  <p>That which chiefly crown'd and ripen'd, as it were, theſe Vertues into Maturity and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:56701:151"/>never fail'd to render him an exact account even of the Minuteſt circumſtances, and gave him a knowledge of her interior diſpoſition to that degree, that being demanded by one of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious what it was to Manifeſt her Conſcience and the whole State of her Soul to a Spiritual Director, ſhe Anſwer'd, <hi>We muſt be very ſincere and candid with him, and tell him even our pasſing thoughts;</hi> upon this ſome preſent deſirous to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the matter, after a more ſerious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, importun'd her to inſtance ſome particulars, that might illuſtrate what ſhe ſaid.

                     <p>A more exact Relation of her Vertues in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THO' in the former Chapter the Religious, whom ſhe convers'd with, have given, as you have Read; an ample Teſtimony of her Sanctity; yet they ſeem rather to reduce what they affirm to General heads, than deſcend to particulars; upon a ſtricter ſcrutiny, I find her Vertues more diſtinctly ſet down by ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations I receiv'd from <hi>Graveling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They begin firſt with that of her Prayer, in which ſhe was ſo recollected, as if God had been viſibly preſent before her, or ſhe had ſpoken to his Divine Majeſty. This Holy Spirit of Prayer and Recollection, whereby ſhe expreſt her Love towards God, was ſtrangely animated and increas'd by her Charity towards her Neighbor, which God gives for a Mark of our Love towards himſelf. All her Actions and deſigns were nothing elſe, but ſo many Acts of Charity, and her chief employment, when ſhe did not entertain her ſelf with God, was to aſſiſt the neceſſities of her Neighbor, and comfort the Afflicted. A whole Cloud of Witneſſes, and indeed as many as there were perſons in that
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:56701:152"/>Holy Community, in which ſhe liv'd, unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly Teſtifie that Siſter <hi>Clare</hi> of <hi>Ieſus</hi> did ſo much excel in Charity towards her Neighbor, that ſhe ſcarce enjoy'd her ſelf, whilſt ſhe perceiv'd another to be in any trouble or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; ſo that their ſorrow prov'd hers, and made her even ready to part with her own content and happineſs to make them chearful. There are a Hundred inſtances in this kind, of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Charity, in which ſhe ſo abounded, that ſhe made it properly her buſineſs to do good to all, and like St. <hi>Paul become all to all;</hi> behold an act of Charity one of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious recounts.</p>
                  <p>There were ſeveral of the Community, who did not underſtand <hi>French;</hi> wherefore Siſter <hi>Clare,</hi> who had ſeveral excellent <hi>French</hi> Books lent her for her own uſe, was not content to enjoy that benefit alone, but moſt willingly imparted the advantage ſhe receiv'd by them, to thoſe, who knew not how to make uſe of them. For this end ſhe obtain'd leave of the Superior to Read an hour in the Work-houſe every Sunday and Holy-day, to thoſe who had a mind to hear her. They who attended to her Reading, affirm that the bare explicating to them the ſenſe of the Book, was more moving than any Sermon; and that they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves tranſported to ſee the Devotion, with which ſhe reliſh'd every word; which ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt with ſuch a Grace and Emphaſis, as made a deep Impreſſion in their Souls: Nor was ſhe
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:56701:153"/>contented with the Practice of this act of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whilſt ſhe was well, but even when ſhe was Sick of a Quartaine Ague, which had reduced her to ſo very low and weak a condition, as forc't her to keep the Infirmary, underſtanding that one of the Lay-Siſters was troubled that ſhe loſt the hearing of what was Read at Table out of a <hi>French</hi> Book, which was much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Religious that heard it, ſhe being employ'd at that time; Siſter <hi>Clare</hi> earneſtly deſir'd leave of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Mother Abbeſs, as weak as ſhe was, that the Siſter might come to the Infirmary when her employments would permit her, and that ſhe might dayly Read to her there, what had been Read at Table.</p>
                  <p>The Touch-Stone of true Love and Charity to our Neighbor, is ſaid to be the Guard of the Tongue; how free ſhe was from a cenſorious Spirit (the unhappy Temper of too many of this Age) may be obſerv'd from hence, that ſhe was never heard to utter the leaſt word, or to offer the leaſt inſinuation in diſpraiſe or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of another, a Habit ſhe had got from a Child, and practis'd not only before her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion (as hath been ſaid) but ever after in ſuch perfection, that the good Name of every one ſeem'd as tender to her, as the Aple of her Eye, and more eſteem'd by her than herown; wherefore ſhe ſet a ſtrict guard, not only upon her Lips, but even upon her very thoughts; knowing how the one does influence the other;
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:56701:153"/>becauſe <hi>according to the abundance of the Heart the Mouth ſpeaks;</hi> wherefore it made her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour not only to baniſh from her own mind all raſh ſurmiſes or cenſures, but to hinder as much as ſhe was able, that the like ſhould not either enter into, or make any abode in the thoughts of others; wherefore, if ſhe heard any thing ſaid leſs to anothers advantage, if ſhe could not excuſe the fact that was recounted of them (which ſhe endeavour'd to do in the firſt place) ſhe always excus'd their intention, and by theſe her Charitable endeavours, either chang'd the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or turn'd it to the advantage of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that were ſpoken of, by taking occaſion of praiſing them for ſome extraordinary Vertue ſhe had taken notice of in them. To this degree of Charity ſhe arriv'd, by a certain agreeable ſweetneſs in her Nature; for 'twas obſerv'd that her word were always ſeaſon'd with terms of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and love, ſo operative, that they heal'd the moſt ſecret infirmities of the mind. Being at work with a Siſter, whom ſhe underſtood to be not only ſick in Body, but alſo in ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior trouble of mind, which proceeded from a tedious indiſpoſition; ſhe kindly embrac'd her and ſaid, <hi>Dear Siſter</hi> (calling her by her Name) <hi>take Courage, God ſees and will reward your ſufferings.</hi> This Charitable expreſſion out of the time alotted for Recreation, utter'd with ſo much affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by her who was ſo exact an obſerver and lover of ſilence, gave the Siſter no leſs cauſe of wonder than of joy and comfort. The love of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:56701:154"/>God mov'd her to the love of ſilence, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to attend to his Divine inſpirations, which nothing could make her break, but the love of her Neighbor, with which he inſpir'd her; and which ſhe knew was no leſs pleaſing to him, when exercis'd for his ſake towards his Image, than when perform'd towards himſelf. All bounds were too narrow for that overflowing goodneſs and zeal ſhe had for the Converſion of Souls; her Tears were in a continual manner ſpent upon this account; ſhe never made an end of urging her Children to offer up their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Devotions for this end; nor was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind return of an angry Father, able to diminiſh the Zeal ſhe had for his Converſion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for his Eternal Happineſs.</p>
